        Link: <a href="https://virginiatech.zoom.us/j/85821418049?pwd=ckxzUGF1dUg4a28rQi9xNlhyZFh1dz09">https://virginiatech.zoom.us/j/85821418049?pwd=ckxzUGF1dUg4a28rQi9xNlhyZFh1dz09</a>
        (Meeting ID: 85821418049, Password: SPLICE).</p>

      <p>CS educators and CS Ed researchers and developers are invited to
        the 10th annual SPLICE meeting, focused on creating new Technology
        and Data Infrastructure for CS Education Research.</p>

      <p>All are welcome to attend.
        But if you plan to attend, it will help us with planning
        if you would fill out this form:

      <p>The mission of the SPLICE project is to develop Technology and Data
        Infrastructure for CS Education Research. At this SPLICE community
        meeting, we invite you to contribute to our SPLICE Working
        Groups, find out about how to apply for a SPLICE mini-grant,
        and hear the latest updates on the SPLICE Portal and
        Catalog.</p>
      
      <p> Many SIGCSE attendees are either developing or using online
      educational tools, and all will benefit from better
      interoperability among these tools and better analysis of the
      clickstream data coming from those tools. New tools for
      analyzing big data leveraged by AI (e.g., deep learning for
      assessment) in turn improve both content and pedagogy,
      thus setting up a virtuous cycle fueling learning discoveries
      and leveraging innovation in AI: Online technologies → big data
      analysis → better online technologies.
      This workshop is the latest in a series of SPLICE workshops.
      This year, we present updates on our work with several new
      SPLICE community working groups, including those on Dashboards,
      Large Language Models, Parsons Problems, and Smart Learning
      Content Protocols. We continue to build upon our existing
      collaborations developed over the course of the project to
      engage more members of the community in tasks that will advance
      the project agenda.</p>

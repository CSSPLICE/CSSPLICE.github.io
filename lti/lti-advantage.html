        <p>
            Learning Tools Interoperability is a specification
            developed by <a href="https://www.imsglobal.org/">IMS Global Learning
            Consortium</a> to establish a standard way to integrate
            remotely hosted learning applications with platforms like
            learning management systems (LMS) and similar educational
            environments. The LTI specification enhances the functionality provided
            by a Tool Consumer and provides instructors with various applications
            that they can embed into their course. <a href="lti/index.html">Click here</a>

          </p>
          <p>
            LTI Advantage is the next step towards interoperability. It is a package
            of extensions that enables deeper integration of tools with an LMS. These
            extensions are built on the core LTI standard (v1.1 or higher).
            These are the three current LTI Advantage extensions:
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Names and Role Provisioning Services:</strong> This extension
            enables an LMS to send a list of course participants and faculty-defined
            groups to learning tools. It also allows the LMS to learn who has not yet
            accessed a tool. These features used to be called "Membership Service".
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Deep Linking:</strong> Provides a more intuitive way to add
            content from a tool provider by providing support for various types of
            content items such as a playlists, hyperlinks, iframes or files. It is the
            new name for "Content Item Message".
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Assignment and Grade Services:</strong> Enables tools to pass
            the results of assignment back to the LMS. Along with the scores, it also
            supports comments to be returned to the LMS if provided. It enables
            instructors to maintain grades and comments in a single place (such as
            the LMS grade book). It is the new name for "Gradebook Service".
          </p>
          <p>
            So, we see that LTI Advantage is mainly a collection of features that
            already existed within LTI.
          </p>
          <br>
          Following is a detailed explanation of these extensions, with
          examples taken from the IMS website.
          <br>
          <h3>Names and Role Provisioning Services</h3>
          <p>
            Names and Role Provisioning Services provides access to data about
            users' roles within a course, such as list of enrollments in a
            course. It automates course enrollment in tool providers and enables
            instructors to receive reporting on student activity within a learning
            tool, such as the list of users and their roles or a list of those
            participants who have not accessed the course yet. LTI does not pass user
            information in its default configuration. Names and Role Provisioning
            Services automates the provision of student lists to an external tool.
            Sending the list of students enables the external tool to pre-provision
            accounts for all users, rather than creating one when the student
            launches it for the first time.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order for a tool to be able to use this service, the tool
            consumers have to pass an endpoint as a custom parameter with the name of
            <strong>custom_context_memberships_url</strong>. To implement Names and
            Role Provisioning Services, a Tool Provider only needs to send a signed
            GET request to this endpoint and in return the Tool Provider will receive
            a membership list.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            A Tool Provider can send one or more of the following query parameters in
            a GET request:
            <p>
              <strong>role</strong> - The specific role for a membership. Following
              are the roles available in Canvas.<br>
              <div class="text-center">
                <img src="lti/lti_roles.png", style:'width:50%' >
              </div>
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>limit</strong> - Limit the maximum number of items per page.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>rlid</strong> - Memberships having access to this resource link.
            </p>
            <p>
              The following code fetches first five users with role
              <em>urn:lti:role:ims/lis/Learner</em> who have access to a resource
              link with ID rl999.
              <pre>
                <code>role=urn%3Alti%3Arole%3Aims%2Flis%2FLearner&limit=5&rlid=rl999</code></pre>
            </p>
          </p>
          <h3>Deep Linking</h3>
          <p>
            Deep Linking provides a more intuitive way to add various types of
            content items from a Tool Provider (TP) into the tool consumer. This
            extension supports different types of content items such as a hyperlink,
            an embedded image or other media type, embedded HTML, iframe and a file.
            A typical use case as mentioned by IMS would be "to allow a user
            within a Tool Consumer (TC) to click a button on the toolbar of a text
            box editor, which opens a Tool Provider within an iframe (or pop-up
            window), use the interface provided to select one or more items, and have
            the selected item(s) returned to the Tool Consumer and inserted into the
            text box. This may be an instructor adding content to a content page, or
            could be a student selecting an attachment to submit as part of an
            assignment".
          </p>
          <p>
            The first step when sending a deep linking message is to submit a POST
            request from the Tool Consumer to the Tool Provider. This is similar to
            an LTI launch request except that <em>lti_message_type</em> has a value of
            <em>ContentItemSelectionRequest</em>. The next step is for the Tool
            Provider to verify if this is a valid LTI request. If so, it then provides
            an interface for selecting content items. Once the user selects content
            items, the Tool Provider should return the details of selected items in a
            JSON array back to the Tool Consumer at the URL defined in the
            <em>content_item_return_url</em> parameter. Remember that Tool Provider
            should always return the user back to the Tool Consumer even if they do
            not select any items.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a Tool Consumer sends a POST request to a Tool Provider, it may send
            the following parameters:
          </p>
          <strong>lti_message_type=</strong> ContentItemSelectionRequest (Required)
          <p>
            The ContentItemSelectionRequest in lti_message_type indicates that this
            request represents a deep linking selection message.
          </p>
      
          <strong>lti_version=</strong> LTI-1p0 (Required) <br>
          <p>
            The version of the LTI specification.
          </p>
      
          <strong>accept_media_types=</strong>
          application/vnd.ims.lti.v1.ltilink,image/*, text/html (Required)
          <br>
          <p>
            A comma-separated list of MIME types which the Tool Consumer can accept.
          </p>
      
          <strong>accept_presentation_document_targets=</strong>
          embed,frame,iframe,window,popup,overlay (Required)
          <br>
          <p>
            A comma-separated list of possible ways in which the selected content
            item can be requested to open within the Tool Consumer. <em>None</em>
            means that the content item is not intended for display and will only be
            used for storing or processing.
          </p>
      
          <strong>content_item_return_url=</strong> [URL] (Required) <br>
          <p>
            A URL where the Tool Provider redirects the user back to the Tool
            Consumer.
          </p>
      
          <strong>accept_unsigned=</strong> false | true (Optional)
          <br>
          <p>
            Indicates whether the the Tool Consumer accepts an unsigned return
            message or not.
          </p>
      
          <strong>accept_multiple=</strong> false | true (Optional)
          <br>
          <p>
            Indicates if the user can select multiple content items or not.
          </p>
      
          <strong>accept_copy_advice=</strong> false | true (Optional)
          <br>
          <p>
            Indicates if the Tool Consumer will make a local copy of a content item.
            Tool Providers can send the <em>expiresAt</em> parameter to let
            the Tool Consumer know that the item will expire on that date.
          </p>
      
          <strong>accept_unsigned=</strong> false | true (Optional)
          <br>
          <p>
            Indicates whether the Tool Consumer accepts an unsigned return
            message or not.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            Along with the fields mentioned above, the Tool Consumer can also send
            additional fields like text, title, data, auto_create (to indicate if
            content items returned by the Tool Provider would be automatically
            persisted) and other parameters about the Tool Consumer and the user.
          </p>
          <br>
      
          <p>
            Once content item(s) has been selected, the Tool Provider should redirect
            the user to the Tool Consumer by a sending POST request. It may send the
            following parameters in the request:
          </p>
      
          <strong>lti_message_type=</strong> ContentItemSelection (Required)
          <br>
          <p>
            ContentItemSelection indicates that this message contains an array of
            content items.
          </p>
      
          <strong>lti_version=</strong> LTI-1p0 (Required)
          <br>
          <p>
            This indicates the version of the LTI specification.
          </p>
      
          <strong>content_items=</strong> [JSON Array] (Optional)
          <br>
          <p>
            This should be a JSON array containing details for each of the items
            selected. The following example for the content_items parameter value
            is taken from IMS website:
            <pre>

          <strong>data=</strong> [Same as received] (Optional)
          <br>
          <p>
            If the Tool Consumer sent this parameter in the original request, then the
            Tool Provider should return it as is back to the Tool Consumer.

            Along with the above parameters, the Tool Provider can return additional
            parameters such as <em>lti_log</em> to give the Tool Consumer a message
            to log when it returns normally, <em>lti_errorlog</em> to give Tool
            Consumer a plain text error message to log when the Tool Provider
            encounters an error, and <em>lti_errormsg</em> to provide details about
            error to display to the user.

        <h3>What It Is</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/learning-tools-interoperability">
          Learning Tools Interoperability</a> (LTI) is a specification
          developed by <a href="https://www.imsglobal.org/">IMS Global Learning
            Consortium</a>.
          The purpose of LTI is to establish a standard way to integrate
          remotely hosted learning applications with platforms like
          learning management systems (LMS) and similar educational
          environments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Learning applications are called <strong>Tools</strong>, and they
          are delivered by <strong>Tool Providers</strong>.
          These are things like interactive exercises that a student might
          do for a grade.
          <br><br>
          The LMS (systems
          like <a href="https://www.canvaslms.com/">Canvas</a>,
          <a href="https://moodle.org/">Moodle</a>, etc), or platform,
          is called a <strong>Tool Consumer</strong>.
          At the moment, Canvas is the LMS that is most advanced in its
          support for LTI since Instructure is a major participant in the
          IMS consortium.
          But other LMS also support LTI, and so you can use the
          techniques described at this site to integrate tools with many LMS.
        </p>
        <h3>Some Useful Examples</h3>
        <p>
          The LTI specification enhances the functionality provided by a
          Tool Consumer and provides instructors with various applications
          that they can embed into their course.
          For example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://codeworkout.cs.vt.edu/">Code Workout</a> is
            a tool developed at Virginia Tech. It lets students answer and
            get credit for small programming exercises.
            As a third-party tool, Code Workout is hosted on Virginia Tech's
            servers. Canvas (or another LTI-compliant LMS acting as a Tool
            Consumer) integrates Code Workout seamlessly as a Canvas
            Assignment embedded in a Canvas page. This enables students to
            work coding exercises from within Canvas in the same way that
            they might do any Canvas-native assignment, and receive a score
            in the Canvas gradebook for doing that assignment.

                   target="_blank">Wikipedia LTI application</a>
            lets instructors search through English Wikipedia articles
            and link to or embed these articles into course material.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <a href="https://www.eduappcenter.com/apps/12#.WcFgotOGM0p"
                   target="_blank">Piazza LTI application</a>
            adds a link to Canvas course navigation for Piazza discussions,
            and auto-logs the user into the piazza discussion area from
            the LMS.
          </li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3 id="Introduction">How It Works (Simple Version)</h3>
    
        <p>
          LTI enables the tool consumer to send a user to the tool
          provider in a trusted way.
          The trust assertion allows the user to be automatically signed
          in to the tool provider and directed to the specific content
          content being provided by the tool provider.<br>
          <br>
          <div class="thumbnail" style="float: right; width: 300px; margin-left: 10px;">
            <%= image_tag "iframe.png" %>
          </div>
          <strong>Launch:</strong> The LMS (consumer) launches the tool
          (provider) in an iframe, so it feels like a part of the LMS, as
          shown in the picture.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Security:</strong> LTI Authentication uses the OAuth
          standard, which is a secure protocol over HTTPS for
          communication between different systems.
          The consumer and a provider share a
          <strong>consumer key</strong> and
          <strong>shared secret</strong> via an HTTP POST request.
          They are used to sign any messages passed between the two
          systems.
          The signature is done through OAuth, so that the signatures can
          be verified by either party.

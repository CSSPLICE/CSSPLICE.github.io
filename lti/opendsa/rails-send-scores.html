        <h1>Rails LTI Tool Provider - Send Scores back to Canvas</h1>
      </div>
      <p>
        In our <a href="lti/exercises/rails.html">previous tutorial</a>,
        we showed how to create a basic LTI Tool Provider such as an
        eBook or another application that works with a Tool Consumer
        like Canvas.
        But one of the major benefits of LTI is that it enables
        Instructors to add different kinds of assessments (such as an
        exercise of a unique type) that are not otherwise available in
        Tool Consumers like Canvas.
        In this tutorial, we show how to make your assessment
        application LTI compatible, and send the scores back
        to a Tool Consumer.
        <br><br>
        We have created a basic Ruby on Rails quiz application.
        By following the steps below, you can take
        the <a href="https://github.com/CSSPLICE/LTI/tree/master/Quiz">code
        for the stand-alone quiz application</a>, or your own Rails
        application, and make it LTI compatible, sending the results of
        student's assessment back to any Tool Consumer.
      </p>
      <p>
        This tutorial assumes that you have read through the
        <a href="lti/building-lti-tool.html">basic steps</a>
        for creating an LTI-compliant application, and that you have at
        least a little familiarity with Ruby on Rails.
      <p>
        <strong>Step 1:</strong>
        Add this <a href="https://github.com/instructure/ims-lti">Ruby
          Gem</a> to the <i><strong>Gemfile</i></strong> of your Rails
        application.
        It helps in performing most LTI tasks,
        such as validating and authenticating LTI requests.<br>
        <pre>
          gem 'ims-lti', '~> 1.1.8'</pre>
      </p><br>
      <p>
        <strong>Step 2:</strong>
        Before tool consumers can send a request to your tool, they
        will have to add your app.
        To do so, they need a key and a secret.
        Create a new config
        file <i><strong>config/lti_settings.yml</strong></i>, and add a
        key and a secret to that file.
        The lti_settings.yml file should contain the following:
  
        <pre>
          production:
            quizkey: 'FirstSecret'
  
          development:
            quizkey: 'FirstSecret'</pre><br>
  
        Once you share your unique keys and secrets with a tool
        consumer, it will be able to add your application.
        Here is an example of the interface that Canvas uses:
  
        <br><br>
        <div class="text-center">
          <img src="../quiz_keysecret.png", style:';width:128px;height:128px;', alt="quiz keysecret" >
        </div><br><br>
  
        If you create a new settings file, you need to create a variable
        that loads the content from your settings file. Add this line
        in <i><strong>config/application.rb</i></strong><br><br>
        <pre>
          config.lti_settings = Rails.application.config_for(:lti_settings)
        </pre>
        This variable will load the key and secret from your settings
        file.<br><br>
  
        You can change the <em>quizkey</em> and <em>FirstSecret</em> in this
        example to what you like but each key/secret pair should be distinct for
        each tool consumer.
        If you knew that 10 different institutes/instructors
        want to integrate your tool into their courses, you might create
        10 key/pairs.
      </p><br>
  
      <p>
        <strong>Step 3:</strong>
        Along with a key and a secret, the tool consumer will also need a
        url where it can send a request. For that purpose, create a
        controller named <i><strong>lti</i></strong> with
        a <i><strong>launch</i></strong> endpoint (so the url can say
        '..../lti/launch' for readability). This launch endpoint will
        receive the post request from the tool consumer, and we will
        validate and authenticate the LTI requests within this
        endpoint.
      </p><br>
  
      <p>
        <strong>Step 4:</strong>
        We need to keep a check if our application is
        launched as an LTI application or not.
        If it is launched as an LTI application, then we will have to
        make a few changes to the normal behavior of our app.
        Typically, we might need to hide the header and footer that we
        display to other users, because the application will load in an
        iframe.
        In that context, it should look like a part of a Tool
        Consumer.
        Also, we will have to send scores back to the Tool Consumer.
        This might imply that we don't want to show the results to the
        user ourselves, such as displaying a results page.
        For example, our simple Quiz application will
        look like this if you do not remove the header from an
        LTI launch:
        <div class="text-center">
          <img src="../quiz_no_iframe.png", style:'width:128px;height:128px;', alt="quiz no iframe" >
        </div><br><br>
  
        To fix this, add the following line at the beginning of the
        <em>launch</em> endpoint.
        <pre>
          session[:isLTI]=true</pre>
        To hide the header, add the following
        in <em>views/layout/application.html.erb</em> after moving
        header code in the <em>_header</em> partial.
        <br><br>
        <pre>
          render "layouts/header" unless session[:isLTI]</pre>
        Now, when your application is launched inside a tool provider
        like Canvas, it will look like this:
        <div class="text-center">
          <img src="../quiz_iframe.png", style:'width:128px;height:128px;', alt="quiz iframe" >
        </div><br><br>
      </p><br>
  
      <p>
        <strong>Step 5:</strong>
        When your app is launched from a Tool Consumer (such as Canvas),
        it will send a post request to your launch endpoint with a
        bunch of parameters. One of the received parameters in the
        request will be <i><strong>oauth_consumer_key</i></strong>.
        This key should be exactly the same as the one we defined
        in the <i><strong>settings.yml</i></strong> file.
        The first step in a request validation is to check whether this
        received key is present in your system.
        If the key is not present, then throw an error.
        Add the following code inside the launch endpoint for key
        validation:
        <pre>
          if not Rails.configuration.lti_settings[params[:oauth_consumer_key]]
            render :launch_error, status: 401
            return
          end </pre><br>
  
        The code above checks if the key is present in the settings
        variable you created in step 2. If the key is not present, then
        redirect the user to <strong>launch_error</strong> page. We will
        create this page later in this tutorial.
      </p><br>
  
      <p>
        <strong>Step 6:</strong>
        If the key is present, then we move to the second step of
        validation, which is to (1) check whether the request is a valid LTI
        request, and (2) verify the authenticity of the Tool Consumer. <br>
        <ol>
          <li>To check if the request is a valid LTI request, we need to
            check if The POST request contains
            <strong>lti_message_type</strong> with a value
            of <em>basic-lti-launch-request</em>, <strong>lti_version</strong>
            with a value of <em>LTI-1p0</em> for LTI 1, and
            a <strong>resource_link_id</strong>. If any of these are
            missing, then the request is not a valid LTI request.
          </li>
          <li>
            If this is a valid LTI request, then we need to
            validate its authenticity.
            An authentic LTI request will have
            <strong>oauth_signature</strong> along with
            the <strong> oauth_consumer_key </strong>.
            We have already validated in Step 4 if the key is present or not.
            The next step is to generate a signature from this key and its
            corresponding secret that we have stored, and compare it
            with <strong>oauth_signature</strong>.
            If the two signatures match, only then the request is valid.
          </li>
        </ol>
        Fortunately, the IMS-LTI gem will do both of these steps for us.
        It will validate the LTI request and will also perform OAuth
        authentication.
        Add the following code in the launch endpoint.
        The first part creates a Tool provider object with a key and a
        secret.
        The second part validates the request.
        If the validation or authentication fails, it will
        redirect the user to <strong>launch_error</strong> page.<br><br>
  
        <pre>
          require 'oauth/request_proxy/action_controller_request'
          @provider = IMS::LTI::ToolProvider.new(
            params[:oauth_consumer_key],
            Rails.configuration.lti_settings[params[:oauth_consumer_key]],
            params
          )
  
          if not @provider.valid_request?(request)
            # the request wasn't validated
            render :launch_error, status: 401
            return
          end</pre>
      </p><br>
  
      <p>
        <strong>Step 7:</strong>
        At this point, you have a valid and authentic LTI request.
        Now, our quiz application requires a user to be logged in order
        to take a quiz.
        But this application will be launched through Canvas, and a key
        goal of LTI is to provide a seamless experience to the user.
        Therefore, we will have to create a user account and log
        her in automatically.
        To do so, add the following code.
        <pre>
          @@launch_params=params;
          email = params[:lis_person_contact_email_primary]
          @user = User.where(email: email).first
          if @user.blank?
            @user = User.new(:username => email,
              :email => email,
              :password => email,
              :password_confirmation => email)
            if !@user.save
              puts @user.errors.full_messages.first
            end
          end
  
          #Login the user and create his session.
          authorized_user = User.authenticate(email,email)
          session[:user_id] = authorized_user.id
  
          #redirect the user to give quiz starting from question id 1
          redirect_to(:controller => "questions", :action => "show", :id => 1)</pre>
  
        In the first line we save request parameters, because we will
        need those to submit scores back to the Tool Consumer.
        Then we check if any user with this email already exists in our
        database.
        If not, then we create a new user.
        After that, we login the user and create his session.
        Finally, we redirect the user to the quiz, starting from
        question id 1.
      </p><br>
  
      <p>
        <strong>Step 8:</strong>
        Our quiz application normally redirects the user to a results
        page once she finishes all the questions.
        But when launched via LTI from within a tool consumer, we
        instead want to submit the score back without launching the
        page.
        T do this, modify the code at the end of
        the <em>submitQuestion</em> endpoint
        in the <em>Questions</em> controller to the following.
        <pre>
          if session[:isLTI]
            @@result = @@count.to_f/(@@count+@@falseCount)
            @@count = 0
            @@falseCount = 0
            redirect_to(:controller => "lti", :action => "submitscore", :result
            => @@result)
          else
            @@result = @@count
            @@count = 0
            @@falseCount = 0
            redirect_to(:action => "result")
          end
        </pre>
        In this code, we check if the isLTI session variable is set.
        If so, then submit the score back to tool consumer, otherwise
        redirect the user to the results page.
        The score that we pass back must be in range of 0 to 1, which
        is why we divide total correct answers with total questions.
      </p><br>
      <p>
        <strong>Step 9:</strong>
        Now create a new end point <strong>submitscore</strong>
        to submit the score back to tool consumer.
        Add the following code in the <em>lti</em> controller.
        <pre>
          def submitscore
            @tp = IMS::LTI::ToolProvider.new(
              @@launch_params[:oauth_consumer_key],
              Rails.configuration.lti_settings[@@launch_params
              [:oauth_consumer_key]],
              @@launch_params)
            # add extension
            @tp.extend IMS::LTI::Extensions::OutcomeData::ToolProvider
  
            if !@tp.outcome_service?
              @message = "This tool wasn't lunched as an outcome service"
              puts "This tool wasn't lunched as an outcome service"
              render(:launch_error)
            end
  
            res = @tp.post_extended_replace_result!(score: params[:result])
  
            if res.success?
              puts "Score Submitted"
            else
              puts "Error during score submission"
            end
          end
        </pre>
        This code creates a tool provider object using the
        parameters we received in our request.
        We extend the tool provider object with the OutcomeData
        extension provided by the IMS-LTI gem.
        <br>
        First we have to check whether the tool was launched as an
        outcome service or not.
        This means that if the tool was launched as an assignment,
        then we have to send the final result of an assessment back to the tool
        consumer.
        Therefore, in its request it
        sends <strong><em>lis_outcome_service_url</em></strong>
        and <strong><em>lis_result_sourcedid</em></strong>.
        The fist parameter is a URL used to send the score back, and
        the second parameter identifies a unique row and column within
        the Tool Consumer's gradebook.
        If these two parameters are not present, then we redirect the
        user to an error page.
        Otherwise we post the result back to the tool consumer.
        The IMS-LTI gem enables us to accomplish all
        of this using 'post_extended_replace_result'.
      </p><br>
      <p>
        <strong>Step 10:</strong>
        The Tool Consumer also tells us in the request where we should
        redirect the user once he completes the assessment
        in <strong><em>launch_presentation_return_url</em></strong>.
        Therefore, we redirect the user back to
        <em>launch_presentation_return_url</em> once
        we submit the scores.
        Add the following line at the end
        of the <em>submitscore</em> endpoint
        <pre>
          redirect_to @@launch_params[:launch_presentation_return_url]</pre>
      <p>
        <strong>Step 11:</strong>
        If you want an instructor to be able to register your
        application in Tool Consumer, you will need XML configuration for your
        app.
        Therefore, you should create a page that provides the XML
        configuration for your app.
        Following is the XML configuration for our quiz app.

      <p>
        <strong>Step 12:</strong>
        Now you have all of the things required to register an application
        in Tool Consumer: key, secret and XML configuration.
        After entering a URL of your XML file (In Canvas, you can also paste your
        XML content) along with the key and a secret
        in Tool Consumer, an instructor will be able see your application as an
        "External Tool" while creating an assignment or quiz.
        <br><br>
        <div class="text-center">
          <img src="../quiz_ext.png", style:'width:64px;height:64px;', alt="quiz ext" >
        </div><br><br>
  
      </p><br>
      <p>
        <strong>Step 13:</strong>
        If you launch your application now to take an assessment, you
        will receive the following error:
        <br><br>
        <div class="text-center">
          <img src="../invalid_authenticity.png", style:'width:128px;height:128px;', alt="invalid authenticity" >
        </div><br><br>
        To fix this, you need to tell Rails that it does not need to
        verify the user before a launch request.
        Add the following line in the <strong>application controller</strong>.
        <br><br>
        <pre>
          skip_before_action :verify_authenticity_token, only: :launch</pre>
      </p><br>
      <p>
        <strong>Step 14:</strong>
        If you launch your application once again, you should see the
        following warning if your application is not running on
        HTTPS.<br><br>
        <div class="text-center">
          <img src="../quiz_ssl_warning.png", style:'width:128px;height:128px;', alt="quiz ssl warning" >

        To add SSL certificate on localhost, follow the steps mentioned
        <a href="lti/building-lti-tool.html#ssl">here</a>.
      </p><br>
      <p>
        <strong>Step 15:</strong>
        Now, delete your application from Canvas, update your config
        file with the <strong>https</strong> launch URL, and add your
        application again.
      </p><br>
      <p>
        <strong>Step 16:</strong>
        Even now, if you launch your application, you will not see
        anything, but rather you will see the following error in your
        browser console:
        <pre>
          Refused to display 'https://localhost:3000/questions/1' in a frame
          because it set 'X-Frame-Options' to 'sameorigin'.
        </pre>
        <br>
  
        You see this error because Canvas opens the
        LTI Tool in an iframe, but Rails does not allow the application
        to be embedded in an iframe by default.
        Therefore, you need to add the following code in
        the <strong>questions</strong> controller.<br><br>
  
        <pre>
          after_action :allow_iframe, only: [:show, :result]
  
          def allow_iframe
            response.headers.except! 'X-Frame-Options'
          end</pre><br>
  
        In the first line of the code, we tell rails to only allow "show" and
        "result"
        endpoints to open in an iframe.
      </p><br>
  
      <p>
        <strong>Step 17:</strong>
        The last step is to update routes and also to create
        a <strong>launch_error</strong> page, because this is where we
        are redirecting the user if the request is not validated or
        authenticated.
        Create <strong>views/lit/launch_error.html.erb</strong>
        and add the following code to it:
        <xmp>
          <h1>Lunch Error</h1>
          <p>Make sure you have a correct key and a secret to access the quiz
            application.</p>
        </xmp><br>
  
        Since Canvas will also open this launch error page in an iframe
        and we redirect to this page within the launch endpoint, we need
        to allow the launch endpoint to open in an iframe as well.
        Add the following code in the <strong>lti</strong> controller.
        <br><br>
  
        <pre>
          after_action :allow_iframe, only: [:launch]
  
          def allow_iframe
          response.headers.except! 'X-Frame-Options'
          end
        </pre><br>
  
        Now, if the request received is not validated or authenticated,
        you will see the the following on Canvas:<br><br>
        <div class="text-center">
          <img src="../quiz_launch_error.png", style:'width:128px;height:128px;', alt="quiz launch error" >
        </div>
  
        Your <strong>routes.rb</strong> file at the end should somewhat
        look like this for our Quiz application:
        <br><br>
        <pre>
          Rails.application.routes.draw do
            get 'quiz/index'
            resources :questions
            post 'questions/submitQuestion'=>'questions#submitQuestion', as:
            :submit_question
            root 'sessions#login'
            get "signup", :to => "users#new"
            get "login", :to => "sessions#login"
            get "logout", :to => "sessions#logout"
            get "home", :to => "sessions#home"
            get "profile", :to => "sessions#profile"
            get "setting", :to => "sessions#setting"
            post "signup", :to => "users#new"
            post "login", :to => "sessions#login"
            post "logout", :to => "sessions#logout"
            post "login_attempt", :to => "sessions#login_attempt"
            get "login_attempt", :to => "sessions#login_attempt"
            post "user_create", :to => "users#create"
            get "all", :to => "questions#index"
            get "result", :to => "questions#result"
            get 'lti/launch'
            post 'lti/launch'
            get 'lti/submitscore'
            post 'lti/submitscore'
          end
        </pre>
      </p><br>
  
      <p>
        At this point you should have a working LTI-enabled quiz
        application.
        It will work as-is for non LTI launches (on your own domain),
        and will also work as an LTI tool when launched from within a
        tool consumer.
        If it is launched from within a tool consumer,
        then once a user submits an assessment, his scores can be
        recorded in the tool consumer's gradebook.
        On Canvas it will look like this:
  
        <div class="text-center">
          <img src="../quiz_result.png", style:'width:128px;height:128px;' alt="quiz result" >
        </div><br><br>

        <h1>Rails LTI Tool Provider</h1>
      </div>
      <p>
        This tutorial is intended to help you understand how to write a
        Tool Provider that works with a Tool Consumer like Canvas.
        We have created a basic Ruby on Rails application that
        implements a basic calculator.
        By following the steps below, you can
        take the
        <a href="https://github.com/CSSPLICE/LTI/tree/master/Calculator">code
          for the stand-alone calculator</a>, or your own Rails
        application, and make it
        available to run from within an LTI-compliant LMS like Canvas.
      </p>
      <p>
        This tutorial assumes that you have read through the
        <a href="lti/building-lti-tool.html">basic steps</a>.
        for creating an LTI-compliant application, and that you have at
        least a little familiarity with Ruby on Rails.
      <p>
        <strong>Step 1:</strong>
        Add this <a href="https://github.com/instructure/ims-lti">Ruby
          Gem</a> to the <i><strong>Gemfile</i></strong> of your Rails
        application.
        This helps in performing most LTI tasks
        such as validating and authenticating LTI requests.<br>
        <pre>
          gem 'ims-lti', '~> 1.1.8'</pre>
      </p><br>
      <p>
        <strong>Step 2:</strong>
        Before tool consumers can send a request to your tool, they
        will have to add your app.
        To do so, they need a key and a secret.
        Create a new config
        file <i><strong>config/lti_settings.yml</strong></i>, and add a
        key and a secret to that file.
        The lti_settings.yml file should contain the following:
  
        <pre>
          production:
            calculatorkey: 'FirstSecret'
  
          development:
            calculatorkey: 'FirstSecret'</pre><br>
  
        Once you share these unique keys and secrets with a tool
        consumer, it will be able to add your application like this:
  
        <br><br>
        <div class="text-center">
          <img src="keysecret.png", style:'width:128px;height:128px;', alt="keysecret" >
        </div><br><br>
  
        If you create a new settings file, you need to create a variable
        that loads the content from your settings file. Add this line
        in <i><strong>config/application.rb</i></strong><br><br>
        <pre>
          config.lti_settings = Rails.application.config_for(:lti_settings)
        </pre>
        This variable will load the key and secret from your settings
        file.<br><br>
  
        The key/secret pair should be distinct for each tool consumer.
        If you knew that 10 different institutes/instructors
        want to integrate your tool into their courses, you might create
        10 key/pairs.
        <!-- But generally, you do not have any idea who will use you apps,
        so you should create a registration page,
        generate key/secret pairs on-the-fly, and store them to a
        database rather than a settings file. -->
      </p><br>
  
      <p>
        <strong>Step 3:</strong>
        Along with a key and a secret, the tool consumer will also need a
        url where it can send a request. For that purpose, create a
        controller named <i><strong>lti</i></strong> with
        a <i><strong>launch</i></strong> endpoint (so the url can say
        '..../lti/launch' for readability). This launch endpoint will
        receive the post request from the tool consumer and we will
        validate and authenticate the LTI requests within this
        endpoint.
      </p><br>
  
      <p>
        <strong>Step 4:</strong>
        When your app is launched from a Tool Consumer (such as Canvas),
        it will send a post request to your launch endpoint with a
        bunch of parameters. One of the received parameters in the
        request will be <i><strong>oauth_consumer_key</i></strong>. This
        key should be exactly the same as the one we defined
        in the <i><strong>settings.yml</i></strong> file.
        The first step in a request validation is to check whether this
        received key is present in your system.
        If the key is not present, then throw an error.
        Add the following code inside the launch endpoint for key
        validation:
        <pre>
          if not Rails.configuration.lti_settings[params[:oauth_consumer_key]]
            render :launch_error, status: 401
            return
          end </pre><br>
  
        The code above checks if the key is present in the settings
        variable you created in step 2. If the key is not present, then
        redirect the user to <strong>launch_error</strong> page. We will
        create this page later in this tutorial.
      </p><br>
  
      <p>
        <strong>Step 5:</strong>
        If the key is present, then we move to the second step of
        validation, which is to (1) check whether the request is a valid LTI
        request, and (2) verify the authenticity of the Tool Consumer. <br>
        <ol>
          <li>To check if the request is a valid LTI request, we need to
            check if The POST request contains
            <strong>lti_message_type</strong> with a value
            of <em>basic-lti-launch-request</em>, <strong>lti_version</strong>
            with a value of <em>LTI-1p0</em> for LTI 1, and
            a <strong>resource_link_id</strong>. If any of these are
            missing, then the request is not a valid LTI request.
          </li>
          <li>
            If this is a valid LTI request, then we need to
            validate its authenticity.
            An authentic LTI request will have
            <strong>oauth_signature</strong> along with
            the <strong> oauth_consumer_key </strong>.
            We have already validated in Step 4 if the key is present or not.
            The next step is to generate a signature from this key and its
            corresponding secret that we have stored, and compare it
            with <strong>oauth_signature</strong>.
            If the two signatures match, only then the request is valid.
          </li>
        </ol>
        Fortunately for us, IMS-LTI gem will do both of these steps for
        us. It will validate the LTI request and will also perform OAuth
        authentication.
        Add the following code in the launch endpoint.
        The first part creates a Tool provider object with a key and a
        secret.
        The second part validates the request.
        If the validation or authentication fails, it will
        redirect the user to <strong>launch_error</strong> page.<br><br>
  
        <pre>
          require 'oauth/request_proxy/action_controller_request'
          @provider = IMS::LTI::ToolProvider.new(
            params[:oauth_consumer_key],
            Rails.configuration.lti_settings[params[:oauth_consumer_key]],
            params
          )
  
          if not @provider.valid_request?(request)
            # the request wasn't validated
            render :launch_error, status: 401
            return
          end</pre>
      </p><br>
  
      <p>
        <strong>Step 6:</strong>
        At this point, you have a valid and authentic LTI request. In
        our example, we store the user id and name in a session and
        redirect the user to use calculator application.
        To do so, add the following code below the code of Step 5.
        <pre>
          session[:user_id] = params.require :user_id
          session[:lis_person_name_full] = params.require :lis_person_name_full
          @lis_person_name_full = session[:lis_person_name_full]
          redirect_to calculator_path</pre>
      </p><br>
  
      <p>
        <strong>Step 7:</strong>
        Now, if you try to register your application in Canvas, you will
        need XML configuration for your app. Therefore, you should
        create a page which provides XML configuration of your
        app. Following is the XML configuration of this calculator
        app. In our XML, we tell Canvas under <em>lticm:options</em> tag
        that we need our Calculator application on Course Navigation.
        <pre lang="xml">

          </xmp>
        </pre>
      </p><br>
      <p>
        <strong>Step 8:</strong>
        Now, you have all the things required to register an application
        on Canvas: key, secret and XML configuration.
        After pasting your XML configuration along with key and a secret
        in Canvas, you should see your application in course navigation. <br><br>
  
        <div class="text-center">
          <img src="../navigation.png", style:'width:128px;height:128px;', alt="navigation" >
        </div><br><br>
  
        You can see here that the Calculator application is added above
        Settings in the navigation menu.
      </p><br>
      <p>
        <strong>Step 9:</strong>
        If you launch your application now, you will receive the
        following error:
        <br><br>
        <div class="text-center">
          <img src="../invalid_authenticity.png", style:'width:128px;height:128px;' alt="invalid authenticity" >
        </div><br><br>
        To fix this, you need to tell Rails that it does not need to
        verify user before launch request. Add the following line in
        the <strong>application controller</strong>.<br><br>
        <pre>
          skip_before_action :verify_authenticity_token, only: :launch</pre>
      </p><br>
      <p>
        <strong>Step 10:</strong>
        If you launch your application once again, you should see the
        following warning if your application is not running on
        HTTPS.<br><br>
        <div class="text-center">
          <img src="../ssl_warning.png", style:'width:128px;height:128px;', alt="ssl warning" >
        </div><br><br>
        To add SSL certificate on localhost, follow the steps mentioned
        <a href="lti/building-lti-tool.html#ssl">here</a>.
      </p><br>
      <p>
        <strong>Step 11:</strong>
        Now, delete your application from Canvas and update your config
        file with <strong>https</strong> launch URL and add your
        application again.
      </p><br>
      <p>
        <strong>Step 12:</strong>
        Even now, if you launch your application from Course Navigation
        menu, you will not see anything and rather you will see the
        following error in your browser console:
        <pre>
          Refused to display 'https://localhost:3000/calculator' in a frame
          because it set 'X-Frame-Options' to 'sameorigin'.
        </pre><br>
  
        You see this error because Canvas opens the
        LTI Tool in an iframe, but Rails does not allow the application
        to be embedded in an iframe by default.
        Therefore, you need to add the following code in
        the <strong>calculator</strong> controller.<br><br>
  
        <pre>
          after_action :allow_iframe, only: [:calculator]
  
          def allow_iframe
            response.headers.except! 'X-Frame-Options'
          end</pre><br>
  
        In the first line of the code, we tell rails to only allow one
        endpoint named <strong>calculator</strong> to open in an
        iframe.
      </p><br>
  
      <p>
        <strong>Step 13:</strong>
        The last step is to update routes and also to create
        a <strong>launch_error</strong> page, because this is where we
        are redirecting the user if the request is not validated or
        authenticated.
        Create <strong>views/lit/launch_error.html.erb</strong>
        and add the following code to it:
        <xmp>
          <h1>Lunch Error</h1>
          <p>Make sure you have a correct key and a secret to access the
            calculator application.</p>
        </xmp><br>
  
        Since Canvas will also open this launch error page in an iframe and we
        redirect to this page within the launch endpoint, we need to
        allow the launch endpoint to open in an iframe as well.
        Add the following code in <strong>lti</strong> controller.
        <br><br>
  
        <pre>
          after_action :allow_iframe, only: [:launch]
  
          def allow_iframe
            response.headers.except! 'X-Frame-Options'
          end
        </pre><br>
  
        Now, if the request received is not validated or authenticated,
        you will see the the following on Canvas:
        <div class="text-center">
          <img src="../launch_error.png", style:'width:128px;height:128px;', alt="launch error" >
        </div>
  
        Your <strong>routes.rb</strong> file should look like this:<br><br>
        <pre>
          Rails.application.routes.draw do
            get 'lti/launch'
            post 'lti/launch'
            get 'calculator', to: 'calculator#calculator'
            root 'calculator#calculator'
          end
        </pre>
      </p><br>
  
      <p>
        Once you are done with all these steps, and Canvas has a valid
        key and a secret, then you should see your application working
        in Canvas. <br><br>
  
        <div class="text-center">
          <img src="../calculator_lti.png", style:'width:128px;height:128px;', alt="calculator lti" >
        </div><br><br>

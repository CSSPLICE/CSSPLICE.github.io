<b>Workshop Theme:</b> CS Education Infrastructure for All:
Interoperability for Tools and Data Analytics</b>
</p>

<b>Workshop Hosts:</b>

  <li> Steve Edwards, Virginia Tech</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Abstract:</b><br/>
CS Education makes heavy use of online educational tools like IDEs,
Learning Management Systems (LMS), eTextbooks, interactive programming
environments, and other smart content.
Instructors and students would benefit from greater interoperability
between these tools.
CS Education (CSEd) researchers increasingly make use of large
collections of data generated by click streams coming from them.
However, students, instructors and researchers all face barriers that
slow progress:
(1) Educational tools do not integrate well.
(2) Information about computer science learning process and outcome
data generated by one system is not compatible with that from other
systems.
(3) Computer science problem solving and learning (e.g., open-ended
coding solutions to complex problems) is quite different from the
type of data (e.g., discrete answers to questions or verbal
responses) that current educational data mining focuses on. 
This NSF-supported workshop is a follow-up to a workshop in Pittsburgh
this past summer that initiated the SPLICE project.
The goal is to support and better coordinate efforts to build
community and capacity among CSEd researchers, data scientists, and
learning scientists toward reducing barriers.
CSEd infrastructure should support
(1) broader re-use of innovative learning content that is instrumented
for rich data collection,
(2) formats and tools for analysis of learner data,
and (3) development of best practices to make collections of learner
data available to researchers.
We will present progress to date on developing a project website,
present initial reports from working groups, and plan activities for
the coming year.

      <h1>SPLICE Working Groups</h1>

      <p>SPLICE Working Groups are ad hoc mini-organizations designated
      to solve a specific problem relevant to the SPLICE project.</p>

      <h2>Small code snapshots</h2>

      <p><b>Leaders:</b> Dave Hovemeyer and Kelly Rivers</p>

      <p><b>Task:</b> Develop representation standards and analysis tools for
        capturing student submissions to small programming
        exercises.</p>

      <p><b>Products:</b> <a href="DATASTAND.pdf">DATASTAND Draft Standard</a></p>
        
      
      <h2>Small coding exercise representation</h2>
      
      <p><b>Leaders:</b> Phill Conrad (UC Santa Barbara), Cory Bart (University of Delaware), Stephen Edwards (Virginia Tech)</p>

      <p><b>Task:</b> Develop representation standards for small
      programming exercises.</p>

      
      <h2>Packaging Curricular Materials</h2>
      
      <p><b>Leaders:</b> Cory Bart (University of Delaware), Phill Conrad (UC Santa Barbara), Michael Hilton (Carnegie Mellon University), Bob Edmison (Virginia Tech)</p>
      <p><b>Task:</b> Developing standards and tools to improve the process of creating/revising/sharing/finding/crediting/etc. curricular materials.</p>
      <p><b>Abstract:</b> Packaging materials is a generalized term to capture a broad array of tasks (creating, revising, sharing, finding, crediting, etc.) for materials such as assignments, teacher notes, and evaluation data. Substantial effort has gone into creating materials over the years, but the community still struggles to find ways to effectively manage these. The working group will develop a standard for curricular material creation and sharing, support tool development to connect this standard with existing popular course management solutions, and work with existing initiatives for creating and managing repositories of materials.</p>

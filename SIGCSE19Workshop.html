<p><b>Abstract:</b><br/>
  CS Education makes heavy use of online educational tools like IDEs,
  Learning Management Systems (LMS), eTextbooks, and interactive
  programming environments.
  Many interactive, auto-assessed exercises, that we refer to as "smart
  content", are now available.
  Instructors and students would benefit from greater
  inter-operability between these tools.
  CS Education (CSEd) researchers increasingly make use of large
  collections of data generated by click streams coming from such
  tools.
  However, students, instructors, and researchers all face barriers that
  slow progress:
  (1) While the standards are improving, educational tools still do
  not integrate well.
  (2) Information about computer science learning process and outcome
  data generated by one system is not compatible with that from other
  systems.
  (3) Computer science problem solving and learning (e.g., open-ended
  coding solutions to complex problems) is quite different from the
  type of data (e.g., discrete answers to questions or verbal
  responses) that current educational data mining focuses on.
  This NSF-supported workshop is the second in a series of SIGCSE
  presymposium events in support of the SPLICE project.
  The goal of SPLICE is to support and better coordinate efforts to
  build community and capacity among CSEd researchers, data
  scientists, and learning scientists toward reducing barriers.
  CSEd infrastructure should support
  (1) broader re-use of innovative learning content instrumented for
  rich data collection,
  (2) formats and tools for analysis of learner data,
  and (3) development of best practices to make collections of learner
  data available to researchers.
  We will present progress on active collaborations and working groups,
  and plan activities for the coming year.

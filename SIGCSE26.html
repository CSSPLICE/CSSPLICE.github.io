        and Data Infrastructure Community Meeting</h1>

      <h2>Twelth SPLICE Workshop Call for Participation</h2>

      <p>All information on this page is currently tentative!</p>

      <p>CS educators and CS Ed researchers and developers are invited
        to the 12th annual SPLICE meeting, focused on creating new
        Technology and Data Infrastructure for CS Education
        Research.</p>

      <p>The mission of the SPLICE project is to develop Technology and Data
        Infrastructure for CS Education Research.</p>

      <p><b>Registration:</b> Coming Soon.

      <p><bWhere/When:</b> Wednesday, February 18, 2026, St. Louis, MO
        (An Affiliated Event with SIGCSE’25)</p>

        <ul>        
          <li>You have CS learner data (e.g., from a tool or study)
            and want to analyze or share it.</li>
          <li>You are looking for datasets from CS courses to do
            analysis (e.g., understand student behavior, train a
            model).</li>
          <li>You create systems/tools to support CS learning that you
            want to be useful in other classrooms. Especially if you
            want your tool to integrate with other tools.</li>
          <li>You teach CS and want to use high-quality learning
            content and tools (like these examples) made by others.</li>
          </ul>

<p><b>What will you do at the workshop?</b> You will:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Learn about existing tools, data and research infrastructure
    that can help you improve your CS teaching and research, and share
    your content with others.</li>
  <li>Opportunity to get feedback on your own research or teaching
    project, with support from like-minded peers, and SPLICE experts who
    can connect you to datasets, tools, and infrastructure that can help
    you accomplish your goals.</li>
  <li>Help shape the next generation of CS research infrastructure.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>How much does it cost?</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Attendance is free. However, you are expected to register
      for SIGCSE’26 TS.</li>

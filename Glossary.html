      <h1>The SPLICE Glossary<br/></h1>

      <p>Some of the terms used by our community might seem
        unusual. Hopefully our glossary can help.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>SPLICE: Standards, Protocols, and Learning Infrastructure
          for Computing Education.<br/>
          This is our project!</li><br/>
        <li>SLC: Smart Learning Content<br/>
          The definition is a bit vague. But the idea is that this is
          an interactive learning activit that a student does on a
          computer, often with the context of an eTextbook or an
          LMS.</li><br/>
        <li>LTI: Learning Tools Interoperability<br/>
          A standard for letting educational tools (including SLC and
          LMS) talk to each other. For all practical purposes, this is
          the one that most CS Education tool builders use now. For
          more information,
          see <a href="http://splice.cs.vt.edu/lti">here</a>.</li><br/>

        <li>IDE: Integrated Development Environment<br/>
          An application for use when writing computer programs. They
          try to do whatever their developers can think of to help you
          write code, including a file manager, editor, compiler, and
          typically support for things like writing and running unit
          tests.</li><br/>
        <li>LMS: Learning Management System<br/>
          Things like Canvas, Blackboard, Moodle. Used by an
          educational organization to deliver course content, manage
          assignments, grades, etc.</li><br/>

      <p><b>Abstract:</b><br/>
        CS Education makes heavy use of online educational tools like IDEs,
        Learning Management Systems (LMS), eTextbooks, and interactive
        programming environments.
        Many interactive, auto-assessed exercises, that we refer to as "smart
        content", are now available.
        Instructors and students would benefit from greater
        inter-operability between these tools.
        CS Education (CSEd) researchers increasingly make use of large
        collections of data generated by click streams coming from such
        tools.
        However, students, instructors, and researchers all face barriers that
        slow progress:
        (1) While the standards are improving, educational tools still do
        not integrate well.
        (2) Information about computer science learning process and outcome
        data generated by one system is not compatible with that from other
        systems.
        (3) Computer science problem solving and learning (e.g., open-ended
        coding solutions to complex problems) is quite different from the
        type of data (e.g., discrete answers to questions or verbal
        responses) that current educational data mining focuses on.
        This NSF-supported workshop is the second in a series of SIGCSE
        presymposium events in support of the SPLICE project.
        The goal of SPLICE is to support and better coordinate efforts to
        build community and capacity among CSEd researchers, data
        scientists, and learning scientists toward reducing barriers.
        CSEd infrastructure should support
        (1) broader re-use of innovative learning content instrumented for
        rich data collection,
        (2) formats and tools for analysis of learner data,
        and (3) development of best practices to make collections of learner
        data available to researchers.
        We will present progress on active collaborations and working groups,
        and plan activities for the coming year.
      </p>

      <p><b>Intended Audience:</b><br/>
        The audience is expected to consist of CSEd tool builders, developers
        of student analytics data analysis tools, and CSEd researchers who
        would like to make use of user interaction data collected by their
        own projects or by others.
        We are expecting to support about 30 attendees (though last year's
        workshop grew to over 50).
        This includes members of the learning and data analytics communities
        that do not often attend SIGCSE.
        These attendees would then likely remain for the SIGCSE conference,
        improving synergy within the project among different stakeholder
        communities.

      <p><b>Lightning Talk Call for Papers and Presentations:</b><br/></p>

      <p>
        We are providing an opportunity for participants to submit 2-page
        papers about their past and ongoing work related to CS Education
        Infrastructure. You can indicate interest in making a presentation
        at the attendance survey. The papers should be submitted in ACM
        SIGCSE format by e-mail to the workshop organizers before or on
        TBD. The authors of accepted Lightning Talk papers
        will be able to present their work in at the workshop as Lightning
        Talks of about 12 minutes with 3 minutes for questions.
        The papers will be published online as
        a part of the Workshop Proceedings and will be publicized on the the
        SPLICE project site.
      </p>

      <p>
        We are specifically looking for papers about collaborations and
        integrations in the spirit of the SPLICE project. So if you have a
        working collaboration where you are integrating software tools
        and/or smart content, or are sharing learner analytics data analysis
        tools or data sets, then we would like to hear about it.  Most
        valuable in the context of the workshop would be Lightning Talk
        Papers focusing on the following three topics, although all work
        related to the SPLICE goals will be considered.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Descriptions of "smart" learning tools or programming
          environments, which interact with students and collect
          interaction/performance data.
        <li> Descriptions of infrastructures that could integrate multiple
          "smart" learning tools.
        <li> Case studies of collaboration where reproducible practices were
          used to integrate two or more data-producing learning tools from
          differing institutions.
      </ul>

      <p><b>Agenda:</b><br/>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> 8:30 -- 5:00: TBD
      </ul>

      <p><b>Attendee Support:</b><br/>
        We hope to provide this event for free to participants.

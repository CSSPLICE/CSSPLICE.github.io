        Tuesday, March 16, 2021. The sessions will run from
        10:00am-12:30pm each day.

      <p><b>Abstract:</b><br/>
        Increasingly, the meat of many CS courses is provided by many
        interactive, auto-assessed exercises, referred to as "smart
        content". These tools engage students, provide valuable
        feedback, and allow collection of data for further
        analysis. While it remains a challenge to connect these tools
        to learning management systems (LMS), eTextbooks and IDEs,
        standards like Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) make it
        possible. Interoperability is improving year by
        year. Collecting, distributing, and analyzing the rapidly
        growing collections of data generated by click streams coming
        from such tools is still a major challenge. But progress is
        being made both in improved analysis tools and in standards
        for collecting data, like student attempts at solving
        programming problems This NSF-supported workshop is the third
        in a series of SIGCSE pre-symposium events in support of the
        SPLICE project. The goal of SPLICE is to support and better
        coordinate efforts to build community and capacity among
        Computer Science Education (CSEd) researchers, data
        scientists, and learning scientists toward reducing
        barriers. CSEd infrastructure should support (1) broader
        re-use of innovative learning content instrumented for rich
        data collection, (2) formats and tools for analysis of learner
        data, and (3) development of best practices to make
        collections of learner data available to researchers. The
        organizers and presenters will share progress from ongoing
        projects and collaborations, attempting to build an agenda for
        the community to strive for in the coming years.

      <p><b>Important Dates:</b><br/>
        <ul>
          <li>Final versions of accepted papers March 9, 2021
          <li>The workshop: March 15-16, 2021
          <li>SIGCSE Conference: March 15-20, 2021
        </ul>

        
      <p><b>Intended Audience:</b><br/>
        The audience is expected to consist of CSEd tool builders,
        developers of student analytics data analysis tools, and CSEd
        researchers who would like to make use of user interaction
        data collected by their own projects or by others. We are
        expecting about 50 attendees.
      </p>

      <p><b>Organization:</b><br/>
        The workshop is organized by the SPLICE (Standards, Protocols,
        and Learning Infrastructure for Computing Education) project team,
        in association with the NSF-supported project
        Community-Building and Infrastructure Design for
        Data-Intensive Research in Computer Science Education. It
        follows a sequence of the previous SPLICE and CSEDM workshops
        organized at SIGCSE, EDM, AIED, ICER, LAK, and ACM L@S
        conferences. More information about SPLICE and past workshops
        can be found at  http://cssplice.org.

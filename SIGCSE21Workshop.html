        CS Education Infrastructure for All III: From Ideas to Practice
      </h1>

      <p>
        The seventh SPLICE Project workshop will be held in
        conjunction with SIGCSE 2021, online, on Monday, March 16 and
        Tuesday, March 17, 2021. The sessions will run from
        10:00am-12:30pm each day.
        Please <a href="mailto:cssplice@gmail.com">contact us</a> if
        you have questions.

        <b>Workshop Theme:</b> CS Education Infrastructure for All
        III: From Ideas to Practice
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Location:</b> Online access link to be posted.

        <li> Cliff Shaffer, Virginia Tech</li>
        <li> Peter Brusilovsky, University of Pittsburg</li>

      <p><b>Abstract:</b><br/>
        Increasingly, the meat of  many CS courses courses is provided
        by many interactive, auto-assessed exercises, referred to as
        "smart content". These tools engage students, provide
        valuable feedback, and allows collection of data for further
        analysis. While it remains a challenge to connect these tools
        to learning management systems (LMS), eTextbooks and IDEs,
        skeletons of modern courses, standards like Learning Tools
        Interoperability (LTI) make it possible. Interoperabiliy is
        improving year by year. Collecting, distributing, and
        analyzing the rapidly growing collections of data generated by
        click streams coming from such tools is still a major
        challenge. But progress is being made both in improved
        analysis tools and in standards for collecting data like
        student attempts at solving programming problems 

        This NSF-supported workshop is the third in a series of SIGCSE
        presymposium events in support of the SPLICE project. The goal
        of SPLICE is to support and better coordinate efforts to build
        community and capacity among CSEd researchers, data
        scientists, and learning scientists toward reducing
        barriers. CSEd infrastructure should support (1) broader
        re-use of innovative learning content instrumented for rich
        data collection, (2) formats and tools for analysis of learner
        data, and (3) development of best practices to make
        collections of learner data available to researchers. We will
        present progress from ongoing collaborations, and attempt to
        build an agenda for the community to strive for in coming
        years.
      </p>

      <p><b>Intended Audience:</b><br/>
        The audience is expected to consist of CSEd tool builders, developers
        of student analytics data analysis tools, and CSEd researchers who
        would like to make use of user interaction data collected by their
        own projects or by others.
        We are expecting to support about 30 attendees (though last year's
        workshop grew to over 50).
        This includes members of the learning and data analytics communities
        that do not often attend SIGCSE.
        These attendees would then likely remain for the SIGCSE conference,
        improving synergy within the project among different stakeholder
        communities.

      <p><b>Lightning Talk Call for Papers and Presentations:</b><br/>
      CFP to be posted soon.</p>

      <p>
        We are providing an opportunity for participants to submit 2-page
        papers about their past and ongoing work related to CS Education
        Infrastructure. You can indicate interest in making a presentation
        at the attendance survey. The papers should be submitted in ACM
        SIGCSE format by e-mail to the workshop organizers before or on
        TBD. The authors of accepted Lightning Talk papers
        will be able to present their work in at the workshop as Lightning
        Talks of about 12 minutes with 3 minutes for questions.
        The papers will be published online as
        a part of the Workshop Proceedings and will be publicized on the the
        SPLICE project site.
      </p>

      <p>
        We are specifically looking for papers about collaborations and
        integrations in the spirit of the SPLICE project. So if you have a
        working collaboration where you are integrating software tools
        and/or smart content, or are sharing learner analytics data analysis
        tools or data sets, then we would like to hear about it.  Most
        valuable in the context of the workshop would be Lightning Talk
        Papers focusing on the following three topics, although all work
        related to the SPLICE goals will be considered.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Descriptions of "smart" learning tools or programming
          environments, which interact with students and collect
          interaction/performance data.
        <li> Descriptions of infrastructures that could integrate multiple
          "smart" learning tools.
        <li> Case studies of collaboration where reproducible practices were
          used to integrate two or more data-producing learning tools from
          differing institutions.
      </ul>

      <p><b>Agenda:</b><br/>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Monday, March 16, 10:00am -- 12:30pm: TBD
        <li> Tuesday, March 17, 10:00am -- 12:30pm: TBD
      </ul>

      <p><b>Attendee Support:</b><br/>
        We hope to provide this event for free to participants.

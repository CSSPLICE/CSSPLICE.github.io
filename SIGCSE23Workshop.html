      <h1>SPLICE’23: CS Education Research Technology<br/>
        and Data Infrastructure Community Meeting</h1>

      <h2>Eighth SPLICE Workshop Call for Participation</h2>

      <p>Wednesday, March 15, 2023, Toronto, Canada
        (An Affiliated Event with SIGCSE’23)</p>

      <p>CS educators and CS Ed researchers and developers are invited to
        the 8th annual SPLICE meeting, focused on creating new Technology
        and Data Infrastructure for CS Education Research.</p>

      <p>The mission of the SPLICE project is to develop Technology and Data
        Infrastructure for CS Education Research. At this SPLICE community
        meeting, we invite you to contribute to defining the features of our
        new SPLICE Portal that will provide this infrastructure.</p>

      <p><b>Who should attend?</b> We encourage you to attend if:</p>
        <ul>        
          <li>You have CS learner data (e.g., from a tool or study) and want to
            analyze or share it.</li>
          <li>You are looking for datasets from CS courses to do
          analysis (e.g., understand student behavior, train a
          model).</li>
          <li>You create systems/tools to support CS learning that you
          want to be useful in other classrooms. Especially if you
          want your tool to integrate with other tools.</li>
          <li>You teach CS and want to use high-quality learning
            content and tools (like these examples) made by others.</li>
          </ul>

<p><b>What will you do at the workshop?</b> You will:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Learn about existing tools, data and research infrastructure
    that can help you improve your CS teaching and research, and share
    your content with others.</li>
<li>Opportunity to get feedbacvk on your own research or teaching
  project, with support from like-minded peers, and SPLICE experts who
  can connect you to datasets, tools, and infrastructure that can help
  you accomplish your goals.</li>
  <li>Help shape the next generation of CS research infrastructure.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><b>How much does it cost?</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Attendance is free. (However, you are expected to register
      for SIGCSE’23.) We have some travel funding for the extra night
      in the hotel that attendance at the workshop will likely
        require.</li>

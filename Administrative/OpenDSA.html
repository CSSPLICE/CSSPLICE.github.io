<h2>Initial Project Conception</h2>

<p>OpenDSA began in early summer of 2011 as a collaboration between
  Cliff Shaffer and Ville Karavirta while Shaffer was on an extended
  visit to the research group of Lauri Malmi at Aalto University in
  Finland. At that point, Shaffer had been working for several years
  on the AlgoViz project, which promoted greater use of Algorithm
  Visualization within the CS education community. A key finding from
  AlgoViz was that instructors find it easier to adopt complete units
  of instruction rather than individual visualizations. For example,
  there are many variations on Quicksort. Given access to a
  high-quality Quicksort visualization, there is a strong chance that
  it won't match the code or approach presented in the rest of the
  course instructional materials, making it harder for the instructor
  to integrate and for the students to understand. Better is to give
  instructors the ability to adopt a full Quicksort presentation, or a
  chapter on sorting, or a full data structures textbook.</p>

<p>Karavirta created the JavaScript Algorithm Visualization (JSAV)
  library during Summer 2011 while Shaffer created demonstration
  visualizations and associated explanatory text. They worked
  extensively with Tom Naps of University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh, who
  had a vision for a community-centered, open-source eTextbook
  project. This led to using the name "OpenDSA" for the
  project. Shaffer had recovered the publication rights to a data
  structures textbook that he published in the 1990's, and so had a
  large base of prose to work from. One of the first decisions that
  had to be made was how to author content. After conversations with
  Brad Miller of Runestone Academy, we adopted the Sphinx compiler and
  ReStructuredText (RST), the documentation language of the Python
  community. What made RST attractive to OpenDSA is the ability to
  extend the language through implementing "directives" in Python, and
  the openness of the Sphinx compilation process. This gave us a rich
  authoring tool that could also integrate non-RST elements (like
  visualizations and exercises) into the compiled HTML files.</p>

<p>This gave us all the building blocks for the eventual project:
  RST-based prose integrated with JSAV-based visualizations and
  exercises compiled into HTML pages that could be served to
  users. OpenDSA's fundamental conception is that it provides
  infrastructure and a collection of materials, which allows
  instructors to pick-and-choose from the content to create their own
  eTextbook. The content selections are saved in configuration files
  for future use.</p>

<p>The initial server for managing student logins, serving content,
  and collecting scores was written by Eric Fouh in Django, with the
  initial client-side framework written by Daniel Breakiron. The first
  use of OpenDSA to support a course was for a chapter on sorting for
  a junior-level data structures course at Virginia tech during Fall
  2012. One of the first lessons learned was that while good prose and
  visualizations are important (and students strongly prefer visual
  presentations of algorithms and data structures), the interactive
  exercises are the single most important thing in any eTextbook. Most
  of the early exercises used by OpenDSA were rewritten versions of
  TRAKLA exercises, contributed to OpenDSA by developers at Aalto
  University. OpenDSA was used as the full textbook for Virginia
  Tech's junior-level data structures course for the first time in
  Fall 2013, with full textbook prose, extensive visualizations, and
  automatically graded homework exercises for the full semester.</p>

<p>Since this time, use of OpenDSA has grown to be used by dozens of
  institutions around the world, with full textbook support for course
  in Data Structures (primarily written by Shaffer), senior-level
  algorithms (primarily written by Shaffer), programming languages
  (primarily written by David Furcy and Tom Naps at University of
  Wisconsin-Oshkosh), and formal languages and automata (primarily
  written by Mostafa Mohammed and Cliff Shaffer at Virginia Tech,
  2019-2023). Visualizations and exercises have been developed over
  the years by nearly 100 undergraduate and graduate students at a
  number of universities. By 2020, in a typical semester OpenDSA is
  used in classes at around 15-20 institutions, mostly in the US but
  also around the world.</p>


<h2>Major Development Milestones</h2>

<p>While the original OpenDSA server was written in Django in 2012, we
  recognized the need to move to a system that could better
  interoperate with other systems. A major goal in making a change was
  to break the notion that the OpenDSA server would supply LMS
  features like logins and maintaining scores, that these should be
  offloaded to a real LMS. During Summer 2015, we attempted to develop
  a new server based on the OpenEdX project. By the end of the summer
  we decided that this approach would not work for us. At that time we
  decided to adopt Ruby/Rails as our server implementation. The
  OpenEdX effort and then the initial Ruby/Rails server implementation
  were led by Hossam Shahin. Equally important, we adopted the LTI
  protocol for communicating score information between client, server,
  and LMS. LTI not only allows OpenDSA to communicate with an LMS, it
  also allows use of 3rd-party exercises that support LTI. At about
  that time, Virginia Tech adopted Canvas as the institution's
  LMS. Thus our initial Ruby/Rails server implementation compiled
  books and made them available within Canvas as Canvas module, with
  scores communicated between the client-side runtime framework and
  Canvas (though the OpenDSA server) via the LTI
  protocol. Additionally, OpenDSA can support some integration with
  any LMS that supports the LTI protocol, as we also expose all
  exercises and modules as LTI tools. One weakness of Canvas is that
  only a single scorable entity can appear on a Canvas
  module. Initially this meant artificially breaking up what might
  naturally appear on a page as a "topic" or "section". In 2018
  Jackson Wonderley reimplemented the LTI support so that OpenDSA
  module pages report exercise scores to the server, which in turn
  aggregates the values of various exercises in the module
  appropriately and reports them to the LMS. In this sense, the
  OpenDSA server changed from being just an LTI Tool Provider to also
  an LTI Tool Consumer. This basic server configuration has been in
  place since that time.</p>

<p>While we have always aspired to have the OpenDSA infrastructure be
  easy to install locally by developers and institutions that want to
  use it, it has historically been fairly difficult to install the
  OpenDSA server. In 2021, Alex Hicks and Patrick Sullivan implemented
  a Docker containerized version of the system. Those who only want to
  develop content can easily install this, while those who want to run
  a full server stack capable of serving students in courses can also
  do a relatively easy installation.</p>


<h2>Funding and Support</h2>

<p>Resources to operate and expand OpenDSA has come over the years in
  three forms.

  <ol>
    <li>OpenDSA has been funded by a series of NSF grants. The first
      NSF-TUES program grant in June 2012 had PIs Cliff Shaffer of
      Virginia Tech, Tom Naps of University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh, and
      Richard Baraniuk of Rice University, with the VT share directly
      supporting OpenDSA infrastructure development with $125,000. An
      EAGER program grant from January 2013 to December 2015 supported
      collaboration between Virginia Tech (Cliff Shaffer, $67,000),
      UW-Madison (S. Puntambekar), and Auburn University (Hari
      Narayanan) to work with Aalto University. A major NSF IUSE grant
      for $1,000,000 supported major OpenDSA development from
      2016-2019. While SPLICE grant funding from 2017-2025 does not
      directly support OpenDSA, it does affect bringing OpenDSA
      infrastructure in compliance with community standards such as
      PEML, ProgSnap, and Caliper.</li>
    
<li>As an open-source project, OpenDSA has had tremendous success at
  getting volunteers to help over the years. About 100 people, mostly
  students doing Independent Study or volunteer work, have contributed
  content in the form of individual visualizations or exercises. The
  general model has been that paid graduate students build and
  maintain core functionality, faculty design modules, chapters, or
  books, and students are recruited to volunteer or get credit to
  implement visualizations and exercises.</li>

<li>Starting in 2021, the Department of Computer Science at Virginia
  Tech has contributed a small amount of professional staff time to do
  basic system maintenance, in recognition of OpenDSA's role as
  supplying basic instructional infrastructure. In 2023, CS@VT agreed
  to support OpenDSA directly with 1/4 of an instructor position to do
  core software development.</li>

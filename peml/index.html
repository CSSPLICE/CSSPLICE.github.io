    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>The <b>Programming Exercise Markup Language (PEML)</b> (feedback on
    name choice is welcome!) is intended to be a simple, easy format for
    CS and IT instructors of all kinds (college, community college, high
    school, whatever) to describe programming assignments and activities.
    We want it to be so easy (and obvious) to use that instructors won't
    see it as a technological or notational barrier to expressing their
    assignments.
    </p><p>
    We intend for this format to be something that authors of automated
    grading tools can adopt, so they can provide a very easy, low-energy
    onboarding path for existing instructors to get programming activities
    into such tools. As a result, this notation leans heavily on supporting
    authors and streamlining common cases, even if this may require more
    work on the part of tool developers--the goal is to make it super easy
    for <b>authors</b> of programming activities, not to fit into a specific
    auto-grader or simplify tasks for tool writers.
    </p>
    <p>OK, so this is a new notation. That sucks. But there doesn't seem to
    be an obvious alternative that meets our goals, so ...</p>
    <p>
    Also, in terms of scope of "programming activity", here we are trying
    to capture everything from very small programming activities, such as
    "here's a very short function, fill in the blank to make it work", to
    very large programming activities, such as "write dozens of classes
    spanning thousands of lines of code to implement this programming
    language", or whatever. Yes, that is a very broad range, but the aim
    is to cover the full range, rather than making simplifying assumptions
    that limit PEML to a narrower subset. The reason for using "Exercise"
    in the name of the language is to remind developers that it covers a
    broader range of activities than what many instructors see as pure
    "programming assignments".</p>
  </section>

  <section id="whynot">
    <h2>Why not YAML? or JSON?</h2>
    <p>Actually, one of our design goals is for PEML descriptions to be
    directly mappable to YAML <i>and</i> JSON, so that people who prefer
    one of those notations (or tools that use those notations) can use
    the data model. Converting PEML to YAML or JSON should be a direct/easy
    tool translation that we expect will be provided as a service and/or
    library at some point.</p>
    <p>But why not just use YAML (or JSON) directly, since parsers already
    exist?</p>
    <p>The main reasons are:</p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li><p>These existing formats are not <b>writer-friendly enough</b> for
      descriptions that contain large amounts of free-form text. Face it,
      programming activities usually require
      large-ish chunks of multi-line text to describe most of the interesting
      properties, whether you're talking about the specification for a program,
      or starter code to provide to a student, or reference tests to check a
      solution, or a sample/reference solution to provide for other instructors
      to look at, or whatever. In most cases, PEML is not about simple
      key/value pairs where values are small pieces of data, or about deeply
      structured nested object descriptions. It's about writer-friendly input
      of structured text where most of the values are multi-line text written
      by humans.
      </p>
      </li>
      <li><p>Are not <b>syntax-friendly enough</b> to present a minimal-effort
      entry path. Of course, this isn't an obstacle for programming-oriented
      instructors who have already used YAML (or JSON) and are familiar with
      working with them. However, the sticky bits of those formats do require
      a small learning curve that we hope to minimize further.</p>
      <p>
      In particular, YAML's reliance on whitespace/indentation to indicate
      nested structure can pose an obstacle to more free-form text input.
      JSON's reliance on JavaScript quoting and lack of true multi-line values
      makes it challenging for these tasks in similar ways.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p> Of course, other practitioners have made the same complaints about both
    YAML and JSON before, so "more human-friendly" alternatives to both
    formats have been proposed by others (see
    <a href="#influences">Influences</a> below). Naturally, we were unable to
    find an existing format that exactly met the needs here ... If you happen
    to know of one we've overlooked that would be a better fit, please say
    so! What we are aiming for is a format that allows instructors to
    copy-and-paste content from existing sources (existing assignment writeups,
    program solutions, program text, whatever) with minimal additional
    reformatting work in order to create a readable, streamlined programming
    exercise representation.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="design">
    <h2>Design Goals</h2>
    <p>OK, with the context for this description language out of the way,
    here are the specific objectives we are hoping to achieve:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p><b>Minimal learning curve</b>:
      To paraphrase Cay Horstmann, we are aiming for a format that an average
      computing instructor can learn in under an hour. Further, after a little
      practice, we hope that an instructor who has an existing assignment can
      convert or map it to this representation in less than 10 minutes. We
      want the syntax to be super simple/direct, so that instructors can focus
      just on the specific properties they are describing.
      </p></li>

      <li><p><b>Plain-text file representation</b>:
      PEML uses a plain-text format so that it is easy to edit with any text
      editor. As mentioned above, we want instructors to be able to directly
      copy plain-text content, including relevant code assets or instructions,
      right into the PEML representation. For straightforward assignments
      that do not require any external resources or a special execution
      enviroment setup, the entire description can be written in one simple
      text file. Only instructors with more advanced situations or requirements
      need to use PEML's facility to connect with external resources.
      </p></li>

      <li><p><b>Reference to external resources</b>:
      While the central representation for an exercise is a text file, we
      recognize than instructors may run into situations where one or more
      supporting resources are also necessary for a given exercise (such as
      custom data files, a special library, existing PDF documents, etc.).
      PEML provides a clean way for specifying values through relative and
      absolute URLs. These URLs may refer to remote resources (located online,
      including in git repositories or other locations, docker containers,
      etc.), or local resources located alongside the PEML file.
      </p></li>

      <li><p><b>Directory structure</b>:
      While exercises described as a single text file are easy to transport
      and process, sometimes it may be useful for an exercise to refer to
      external resources stored locally. This can be done by including
      relative URLs in the exercise description (see below). In this situation,
      we can view the subdirectory containing the PEML file as the root of
      an exercise description, with relative URLs referring to other file
      paths within that subdirectory (or subdirectory tree). This allows a
      single PEML file along with its associated local resources to be
      managed as a single local entity.
      </p></li>

      <li><p><b>Zip file packaging</b>:
      Similarly, while a PEML file plus its associated local resources can
      be represented as a subdirectory (or subdirectory tree), they can also
      be packaged into a zip file. The PEML file should be in the root of
      the zip file's internal directory structure, named
      <code>exercise.peml</code>. Relative URLs inside the PEML file will
      then be interpreted within the ZIP relative to the location of the
      PEML file (i.e., relative to the ZIP's root). This makes it easy to
      zip a subdirectory representing an exercise to make it easy to
      transport or upload the PEML file and all of the associated local
      resources, and also makes it easy to unzip a packaged exercise to
      produce a subdirectory representation.
      </p></li>

      <li><p>
      <b>Programming language neutral</b>: PEML should support descriptions
      of programming activities in any programming language, rather than
      being specific to just one. Some fields/assets within one exercise
      description will naturally be programming-language-specific, but the
      notation used to describe the exercise itself should not be.
      </p></li>

      <li><p><b>Minimal technology support</b>:
      Basic PEML descriptions do not require the use of any specific
      supporting technologies to manage build environments, execution
      environments, or external dependencies. This follows from the goal
      to use a simple text file representation (with no external resources)
      for basic programming activities similar to those found in many
      textbooks. We believe simple, low overhead assignments will be the
      most common case. However, we also realize that
      some exercise authors may prefer to use specific tools or technologies
      to package or compartmentalize execution environment features,
      supporting libraries, run-time dependencies, build environments,
      custom testing tools, etc. As a result, PEML is set up to allow such
      services to be used by exercise authors who desire it, but they
      are <i>not</i> required for mainstream (or simple) exercise
      descriptions. In other words, instructors who use "vanilla" assignments
      without any special tooling or infrastructure should be able to hop in
      and describe their existing exercises in PEML without having to learn
      about new tools or technologies.
      </p></li>
    </ol>

  <section id="influences">
    <h2>Influences</h2>
    <p>In terms of inspiration, PEML has been influenced heavily by YAML
    and its relatives (including HAML), as well as many alternative
    notations that have been developed as alternatives for describing
    structured textual data.</p>
    <p>One of the most prominent influences has been
    <a href="http://archieml.org/">ArchieML</a>, another format with some
    overlapping goals used by the New York Times to write certain types of
    online content. PEML reuses big chunks of ArchieML's design.</p>
    <p>The <a href="https://github.com/burningtree/awesome-json">Awesome
    JSON</a> page lists a nice collection of extensions to or alternatives
    to JSON that address some of the shortcomings of using it as a
    human-authored notation, including
    <a href="https://github.com/bevry/cson">CSON</a>,
    <a href="https://github.com/apiaryio/mson">MSON</a>, and
    <a href="https://github.com/lightbend/config/blob/master/HOCON.md">HOCON</a>.
    Other languages like <a href="https://github.com/toml-lang/toml">TOML</a>
    and YAML variants have also influenced this design.
    </p>
    <p>
    Finally, the data model and some of the packaging ideas have been
    influenced by the work of an ITiCSE 2008 working group on the topic,
    which produced this report:
    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/1473195.1473240"><i>Developing a Common
    Format for Sharing Programming Assignments</i></a>.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="format">
    <h2>Basic Format (And an Example)</h2>
    <p>The remainder of this description is split into two main parts:
    first, the format for describing key/value pairs (in this section), and
    second, the data model (in the following section). We view these two
    as independent. As indicated in the <a href="#whynot">Why Not YAML?</a>
    section above, we view the data described for a programming assignment
    as directly representable in PEML, YAML, JSON, etc. We also expect
    that most tools will support either YAML or JSON directly for tooling
    purposes, and that conversions between PEML&nbsp;&lt;=&gt;&nbsp;YAML or
    PEML&nbsp;&lt;=&gt;&nbsp;JSON will be easy. So users who strongly
    prefer an alternate notation can probably freely use one. However, we
    strongly believe that a representation optimized for human authoring
    of structured text consisting primarily of many multi-line text values
    is warranted to make authoring easier for those who don't think/write
    in YAML or JSON regularly.</p>
    <p>OK, on to the format itself.</p>

<i># Single-line comments start with #
# Comments must be on lines by themselves</i>

title: Palindromes (A Simple PEML Example)

topics: Strings, loops, conditions
prerequisites: variables, assignment, boolean operators

instructions:----------
Write a program that reads a single string (in the form of one line
of text) from its standard input, and determines whether the string is
a _palindrome_. A palindrome is a string that reads the same way
backward as it does forward, such as "racecar" or "madam". Your
program does not need to prompt for its input, and should only generate
one line of output, in the following
format:

&lt;pre&gt;
"racecar" is a palindrome.
&lt;/pre&gt;

Or:

&lt;pre&gt;
"Flintstone" is not a palindrome.
&lt;/pre&gt;
----------

[systems]
language: java
version: >= 1.5

[assets.tests]
stdin: racecar
stdout: "racecar" is a palindrome.

stdin: Flintstone
stdout: "Flintstone" is not a palindrome.

stdout: url(some/local/output.txt)

stdin: url(http://my.school.edu/some/local/generator/input)
stdout: url(http://my.school.edu/some/local/generator/output)
</pre>
    
    <p>PEML uses a plain-text representation for
    describing exercises.  This format is designed to be easy to edit in a
    plain text editor.</p>

    <h3>Key/Value Pairs</h3>
    <p>Like YAML, we describe a programming exercise as a series of
    key/value pairs. Wow, big deal.</p>
    <p>In YAML terms, that means the top-level structure of an exercise is a
    <b>mapping</b> (a hash or dictionary).</p>
    <p>Keys are alphanumeric identifiers (starting with
    a letter, and including underscores). This is more restrictive than YAML,
    but the more general idea of allowing any representable value to be a key
    has little utility here and requires more careful parsing and fancier
    quoting rules that only decrease writability and increase the potential
    learning curve ... so, PEML uses the simpler notion that is common in
    many programming language identifier token classes. Note that periods
    can be used to form dotted names to refer to nested keys, as in
    ArchieML.</p>
    <p>Also as in ArchieML, each key must start at the beginning of a line and
    be followed by a colon (for single-valued keys; keys that map to
    collections will instead be either: (a) surrounded by square brackets,
    or (b) surrounded by curly braces, still following ArchieML).</p>
    <p>The corresponding value follows the colon. All values are potentially
    multi-lined values, and extend up to the beginning of the next property.
    Any leading/trailing white space is trimmed (including newlines), and
    multi-line values (i.e., those containing embedded newline(s) after
    trimming) are automatically terminated with a single newline. As a result
    blank lines can appear immediately before any key (or before any unquoted
    value) for visual spacing/chunking as desired without affecting the
    meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
    Like ArchieML, PEML is intended to be parsed line by line, with the first
    non-whitespace sequence on the line determining its role. A simple,
    line-oriented parsing strategy using a basic state machine should be
    sufficient, without requiring complex grammar-based parsing strategies.</p>

    <h3>Comments</h3>
    <p>PEML allows single-line comments using the <code>#</code> character,
    as in YAML. The # character must be the first (non-whitespace) character
    on the line (i.e., only whole-line comments are supported), and the
    corresponding line is completely ignored for the purposes of interpreting
    the meaning of the PEML. Any line beginning with a # character (and any
    leading indentation) is interpreted as a comment line, except in quoted
    values.</p>
    
    <p>
    Inspired by YAML's document start and end markers, PEML uses a specific
    comment line ("#---", a pound sign followed by three dashes) to signal
    the start of a PEML description. This marker is optional for the first
    PEML description in a text stream, but serves as the delimiter between
    exercises if multiple PEML descriptions are presented in a single file
    or stream. The current PEML description continues until the next occurrence
    of this marker (signaling the beginning of a new exercise), or the end
    of input.
    </p>

    <h3 id="quoting">Quoting</h3>    
    <p>
    On occasion, one may end up including text as part of a value that
    might also be recognizable as the start of a key. You can see this where
    the word "<code>format:</code>" appears in the example above, as part
    of the value given for the key "<code>instructions:</code>". In those
    cases, PEML uses a variant of
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_document">HereDoc</a>-style
    syntax, adapted to be more like triple quotes in languages like Python,
    Scala, R, etc.:
    </p>
<pre>
some_key:"""
You can put any multi-line text inside
here and it is treated as if it is
quoted: even when it contains things
that: look
like: keys and values.
"""
</pre>
    <p>Any key where the colon is immediately followed by three or more
    repetitions of the same printing character is treated as having a
    HereDoc-style quoted value, with the provided sequence of repeated
    characters serving as the delimiter. This is more flexible than
    triple-quoting, since triple quotes themselves may appear in program
    fragments for exercises using particular programming languages. This
    technique allows authors to choose a custom delimiter (as with HereDocs),
    but allows them to use repeated punctuation symbols to provide a more
    identifiable/scannable horizontal delimiter around the value, rather
    than using a custom identifier.</p>
    <p>As with HereDocs in many programming languages, the quoted value
    is terminated by the first subsequent occurrence of a line containing
    only the delimiter character sequence.</p>
<pre>
yet_another_key:~~~~~
You can use any printable character as the delimiter,
as long as it is repeated at least three times. The ending
delimiter must exactly match the starting one, and appear
on its own line with no indentation.

Of course, using a punctuation symbol such as -, =, ~, +, etc.,
is encouraged, and use of letters or digits is discouraged
since it may reduce readability.
~~~~~
</pre>
    <p>Of course, many programming languages also use # as a comment character.
    In PEML, # has no special meaning inside a quoted value.
    As a result, we recommend HereDoc-quoting any values that contain source
    code from such a programming language, to prevent a program's comment lines
    from being interpreted as PEML comments.</p>

    <h3 id="embedding-markup">Embedding Markdown (and HTML)</h3>
    <p>Special formatting in the textual description of the
    exercise can be written using
    <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/">Markdown</a>,
    which also supports embedding HTML directly in exercise descriptions.
    So use Markdown or HTML for adding formatting to your text. Plain,
    unformatted text also works, when no special formatting markup is
    desired. Here, we specify git's flavor of markdown.</p>
    <p>
    <i>Note:</i> It is easy to consider adding a key for "text_format:",
    specifying markdown as the default but allowing individual users to
    use other markup formats (such as reStructuredText, AsciiDoc, POD,
    LaTeX, etc.). However, allowing this dialectic specialization risks
    making PEML descriptions harder to port among tools unless all tools
    support the superset of all commonly used formats. Currently, in the
    interests of interoperability, we're restricting text markup to using
    Markdown, but public comments/debate on allowing other formats is welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
    <i>Another Note:</i> Actually, by using
    <a href="https://pandoc.org/">pandoc</a> and a PEML parsing wrapper, it
    should be possible to create a web service that can read
    a PEML document using a wide variety of text markup formats and normalize
    any of them to using github-style Markdown, including reStructuredText,
    many dialects of markdown, many wiki markup languages, Docbook, LaTeX,
    and even Microsoft Word docx files (!). Unfortunately, this doesn't
    address AsciiDoc :-(. At this point, it is plausible to consider supporting
    other markup formats along with an appropriate "text_format:" key if
    community effort can generate the necessary support for adopting tools to
    make use of it (i.e., through a translation web site for converting PEML
    using a different text markup into PEML using github Markdown, for example).
    </p>

    <h3>External Resources</h3>
    <p>
    Values representing external references can be expressed as absolute
    or relative URLs using the "<code>url(...)</code>" construct (similar
    to its use in CSS).
    </p>

<pre>
# An example of an external resource
instructions: url(some/directory/assignment.pdf)
</pre>

    <p>While we strongly discourage the use of PDF assignment descriptions,
    any key value can be farmed out into an external file (or directory of
    files!) that may be
    stored locally (and referred to using a relative URL) or remotely
    (and referred to using an absolute URL). This approach might be most
    used for source code content stored in separate files, test data stored
    in separate files, code libraries, and so on. Also, relative (or absolute)
    URLs used in embedded Markdown or HTML within keys may be appropriate for
    referring to images, downloadable resources accessible to the student,
    etc.
    </p>

    <h3>Splitting Up PEML Descriptions</h3>
    <p>
    In addition to allowing individual key values to be provided in external
    files, PEML adds a <code>:include</code> directive that allows parts of
    the PEML description to be included from another external location. While
    this directive is not strictly necessary, it might be used by some
    authors to factor out repeated key/value pairs (for the <code>license</code>,
    <code>author</code>, environment definitions, etc.) so they can be written
    once and reused across multiple PEML descriptions without repeating the
    content.
    </p>

<pre>
# An example of an external resource
:include url(some/directory/cc-sa-license.peml)
</pre>

    <p>
    Another use for <code>:include</code> is to allow an author to separate
    out the definition of the test cases and test environment for an exercise
    so they are placed in a separate file. This might be useful so that the
    exercise description itself might be public/accessible, but the test cases
    or grading criteria applied to the exercise are managed separately and
    only available to some users.
    </p>

    <h3>Nested Structure</h3>
    <p>
    Beyond these basics, nested properties follow Archie's conventions for
    dotted keys (nested key structure), object blocks, and arrays. The main
    differences here compared to ArchieML is the use of multi-line values
    by default, the use of a HereDoc/triple-quote hybrid rather than a
    specific end marker with escaping of special characters when a delimiter
    is necessary, and support for comments.</p>

<i># Single-line comments start with #

title: Palindromes (A Simple PEML Example)

topics: Strings, loops, conditions
prerequisites: variables, assignment, boolean operators

instructions:----------
Write a program that reads a single string (in the form of one line
of text) from its standard input, and determines whether the string is
a _palindrome_. A palindrome is a string that reads the same way
backward as it does forward, such as "racecar" or "madam". Your
program does not need to prompt for its input, and should only generate
one line of output, in the following
format:

&lt;pre&gt;
"racecar" is a palindrome.
&lt;/pre&gt;

Or:

&lt;pre&gt;
"Flintstone" is not a palindrome.
&lt;/pre&gt;

    <p>Designed to provide an ultra-human-friendly authoring format
      for describing automatically graded programming assignments.</p>

    <h2>Specifying Tests</h2>
    <p>Still writing this! ...</p>

    <p>We expect there to be a wide variety of test specification formats,
    and they may not all be supported by all automated grading tools. Many
    may be programming-language-specific, and only suitable for exercises
    where solutions are written in that one language. However, we feel that
    supporting some variety here is much better than forcing everyone to
    conform to a single format, and limiting assessment actions (and feedback
    possibilities) to that one style only.</p>
    
    <p>Although we're still missing a lot of the details here, we expect that
    this section will include (but not be limited to) at least the
    following:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p><b>Stdin/stdout text segments</b>, for testing main programs that
      read/write text. This will probably include ClodeCoder-style regular
      expression support plus some Web-CAT-inspired normalization options
      so that less-brittle matching can be supported with little effort.
    </p></li>
    <li><p><b>Tables of input values and expected results</b>, which are
      commonly used for assignments that are more functional in nature,
      rather than focused on objects or whole programs. In some ways,
      stdin/stdout testing is a special case of flexible input/output tables
      (just with larger, string-only values).
    </p></li>
    <li><p><b>Native XUnit-style</b> executable software tests (such as JUnit,
      CxxTest, NUnit, pyunit, etc.). These would be language-specific, but
      are already used widely enough, and are expressive enough, that
      they play an important role.
    </p></li>
    <li><p>A <b>custom testing DSL</b> called
      <a href="../pemltest.html">PEMLtest</a> designed to express a wide variety
      of software tests in a more concise, lighter weight way than XUnit
      programming. This DSL supports writing tests for multiple programming
      languages, and test specs can be translated down to executable
      XUnit-style tests in the target language.
    </p></li>
    <li><p><b>Generator-based strategies</b> where inputs of some form and
      expected outputs are programmatically generated fresh for every
      attempt.
    </p></li>
    <li><p><b>Reference solution strategies</b> where input comes from
      one of the approaches covered another way, but expected output is
      produced by running a reference solution provided by the
      exercise author, instead of being described as part of the tests.
    </p></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>We believe that many such test expression formats can all be
    represented as a sequence (array) of hashes, and should naturally fit
    into a data model that is readily expressable in PEML, YAML, or JSON.
    </p>
    <p>We also expect that a variety of test case attributes (visibility,
    weight, scoring, etc.) may cleanly fit in as additional keys within
    a hash representing a test, and thus may be applicable to many of
    the formats listed above.

    OK, more to come later! ...

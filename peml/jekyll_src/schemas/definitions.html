    <p>
      A single file is specified as either a string (consisting of a
      <code>url(...)</code> that defines the file's name, location, and
      content) or an object containing a series of
      nested keys, as described below.

            <small class="text-muted">optional: string</small></h4>
          <p>
            The nested <code>name</code> key provides the name of the file.
            This key is optional, if the name is implied by other parameters,
            or if the tool processing the description supplies a default name.

          <h4 id="file.type">file.type
            <small class="text-muted">optional: string</small></h4>
          <p>
            The nested <code>type</code> key provides the MIME type for the
            file, if needed. This may be used in some cases to ensure the
            tool processes the file as intended, but is optional, since its
            use is tool-dependent.
          </p>
          <h4 id="file.content">file.content
            <small class="text-muted">required: string or array</small></h4>
          <p>
            The nested <code>content</code> key allows for the content of
            the file to be inlined as part of the PEML description in situations
            where that is simpler or more convenient, or where it allows
            the PEML description to be used as a single self-contained
            resource without requiring a zip archive containing multiple
            files. HereDoc-style quote may be useful for inline file content.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, if the <code>>content</code> is being represented
            inline in the PEML description and actually consists of structured
            data, the structured data can be represented directly in PEML
            in the form of a nested hash or an array of records.
          </p>

            <small class="text-muted">optional: string</small></h4>
          <p>
            The nested <code>content_encoding</code> key describes
            the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2045">content transfer
            encoding</a> for binary file contents. For example, when
            inlining the content of a binary file,
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64">base64</a>
            encoding is preferred. What content encodings beyond
            <code>base64</code> are supported is tool-dependent
             (such as <code>quoted-printable</code>, although non-text
             encodings used in smtp and json seem unsuitable for
             inlining files in a text representation, e.g.,
             <code>7bit</code>, <code>8bit</code>, or <code>binary</code>).

    <h3 id="file_set">A Set of Files</h3>

    <p><span class="badge badge-secondary">Schema:</span></p>
{% highlight json %}
"file_set": {
  "oneOf": [
    { "type": "string", "minLength": 1 },
    {
      "type": "array",
      "items": { "$ref": "#/definitions/file" },
      "minItems": 1
    }
  ]
}
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
      Like a single file, a file set can be specified in one of two ways.
      First, a file set can be a single string value, consisting of a
      <code>url(...)</code> that defines the location of a directory (or
      just a single file, if the file set contains only a single element).
      When a URL is specified, the entire subtree is considered to be the
      set of files intended. If the URL actually refers to a file archive
      (*.zip, *.jar, *.tar, *.tgz), and the file set is intended to be the
      contents of the archive instead of that file itself, then use
      <code>extract(...)</code> in place of <code>url(...)</code>.
    </p>
    <P>
      Alternatively, a file set can be a plain
      array, where each item in the array is a single file. In most cases,
      the key name <code>files</code> is used when a file set should be
      provided.
    </p>
    <p>
      When providing an array of files, remember that PEML uses repeated
      occurrences of the first key provided for the first array item to
      mark when each new item starts, so which ever key is provided first
      should consistently be used to start each new item in the array.

  <h2 id="files">Repositories</h2>

  <p>
    While providing remote locations for files is useful, many authors may
    use forms of version control to manage the files or resources referenced
    in an exercise (which is recommended). As a result, it may be useful to
    refer to repository-based locations when a URL is not sufficient. Here,
    we focus on supporting git repositories, although expansions to support
    other useful version control repository structures are welcome.

            <small class="text-muted">required: string</small></h4>
          <p>
            The <code>url</code> key for a repository object provides an
            access path to the repository. This could be an absolute URL
            referring to a net-accessible repository, or a relative URL
            resolved relative to the location of the PEML description.
          </p>

          <h4 id="repository.path">repository.path
            <small class="text-muted">optional: string</small></h4>
          <p>
            The <code>path</code> key for a repository object provides a
            relative path within the repository (relative to the repository's
            root) to identify a specific subtree or resource within the
            repository. This value can be encoded directly in the
            <code>url</code> value, but is provided as an optional separate
            key for readability/writability.

          <h4 id="repository.branch">repository.branch
            <small class="text-muted">optional: string</small></h4>
          <p>
            The <code>branch</code> key for a repository object names the
            specific branch being referenced within the repository, if a
            branch other than the default is desired. This value can be
            encoded directly in the <code>url</code> value, but is provided
            as an optional separate key for readability/writability.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h4 id="repository.tag">repository.tag
            <small class="text-muted">optional: string</small></h4>
          <p>
            The <code>tag</code> key for a repository object names the
            specific tag being referenced within the repository, if desired.
            This value can be
            encoded directly in the <code>url</code> value, but is provided
            as an optional separate key for readability/writability.

          <h4 id="repository.commit">repository.commit
            <small class="text-muted">optional: string</small></h4>
          <p>
            The <code>commit</code> key for a repository object names the
            specific commit being referenced within the repository, if desired.
            Commits are specified using the same identification scheme
            supported by the underlying version control system.
            We strongly recommend using branches or tags where possible,
            since hard-coding commit identities in PEML is brittle.
            This value can be
            encoded directly in the <code>url</code> value, but is provided

<!-- environment -->
<section>
  <h2 id="environments">Environments</h2>
  <p>
  While many PEML descriptions provide straightforward exercises, sometimes
  an exercise may require specific environmental contents, setup, or support.
  Some tools provide a pre-defined environment for building and executing
  exercise answers, but others provide different means of specifying,
  tailoring, or extending the resources available during processing.
  PEML uses the idea of an "environment" to capture the set of resources
  available or used during processing of an answer, although which 
  aspects of answer processing are configurable are tool-dependent.
  </p>
  <p>
    PEML allows exercise authors to specify environmental resources used
    for four separate phases of answer processing in the following order,
    although which of
    these phase(s) are recognized by individual tools are tool-dependent:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>The <b>start</b> phase represents the environment or resources
      given to the learner when they start an exercise, in order for
      them to be able to write an answer (for example, any supporting
      libraries, header files, data files, etc., that should be part of
      the learner's setup in preparing to create an answer). Normally,
      this environment includes all starting resources other than
      skeleton source files (which are provided separately via the
      <code>src</code> key).</p></li>
    <li><p>The <b>build</b> phase represents the environment used to
      compile or build a runnable version of the exercise answer.</p></li>
    <li><p>The <b>run</b> phase represents the environment used to
      run an exercise answer on behalf of the learner, for example, to
      run learner-written software tests or to perform interactive
      debugging executions for the learner to inspect behavior.</p></li>
    <li><p>The <b>test</b> phase represents the environment used to
      evaluate/assess the exercise answer, for example, to run
      exercise-provided reference tests to judge the correctness of
      an answer. Normally, this environment includes all testing
      resources other than actual test cases (which are provided
      separately via the <code>suites</code> key).</p></li>
  </ol>

<section>
  <h3 id="environment">A Single Environment</h2>
  <p>
    All of the environments follow the same basic structure. Some tools
    may support only one environment, and may pick the "phase" that best
    represents that tool's view of how exercises are processed. Other tools
    may support a separate environment for one or more phases. PEML
    descriptions can specify any environment using a nested object
    with the following structure.

    a customizable entry/execution command used for a given phase, for

        <section>
          <h4 id="environment.inherits">inherits
            <small class="text-muted">optional: string</small></h4>
          <p>
            The <code>inherits</code> key for an environment indicates it
            inherits all the contents of (or subsumes) another environment
            (presumably one that appears earlier in the phases).
          </p>
          <p>
            Here, "inherits" basically means that all of the files (or,
            more generally, contents) from the parent environment are used
            as the starting point for this environment, so that additional
            file(s) are added "on top of" the contents specified in the
            parent environment. That allows the new environment to add to
            or overwrite files or resources to define a new environment by
            extension (inheritance).
          </p>
          <p>
            If the new environment specifies a container <code>image</code>,
            it is taken to <i>replace</i> any container image defined in the
            parent environment (that is, images override/replace each other).
            File sets or repositories (which also define sets of files,
            accessed in a different way) are extended/overridden in the
            new environment by imagining the new environment's files are
            copied onto a root with the same contents as the parent environment.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4 id="environment.files">files
            <small class="text-muted">optional: array</small></h4>
          <p>
            The <code>files</code> key for an environment is a
            <a href="#file_set">file set</a> that identifies the files
            that make up the environment. In spirit, these are additions
            to the "root" of the environment used for the corresponding
            phase, although the exact interpretation is tool-dependent.
            While it is easy to associate the "root" with the "current
            working directory" for building or running an answer, some
            tools may interpret subdirectories within the environment
            specially--for example, interpreting a <code>./lib</code>
            nested folder as representing library dependencies, or something
            similar.
          </p>
          <p>
            When <code>files</code> and an <code>image</code> are both
            specified, the interpretation is tool-dependent (well, all of
            the environmental handling is tool-dependent anyway). However,
            we can imagine the for some tools, the <code>files</code>
            describe the contents of a virtual directory tree that might
            be supplied as a parameter to the corresponding container
            image, say through a file system virtual mount or something
            similar.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4 id="environment.repository">repository
            <small class="text-muted">optional: object</small></h4>
          <p>
            The <code>repository</code> key for an environment is a
            <a href="#repository">repository</a> object that identifies
            the files
            that make up the environment by pointing to a version
            control repository (or possibly a path within one). In spirit,
            these are treated exactly the same as the <code>files</code>,
            but simply accessed in a different way by going through a
            version control repository instead. They should also be
            interpreted using the same ideas: the repository contents
            represent additions
            to the "root" of the environment used for the corresponding
            phase, although the exact interpretation is tool-dependent.
            Note that if both <code>repository</code> and <code>files</code>
            are specified, we can imagine them being combined by treating
            both of them as additions to the same concept of a virtual
            directory root. Repository contents should be copied first,
            and file sets second, so that file sets override/add to the
            repository's contribution. If an <code>image</code> is specified,
            the <code>repository</code> value is treated in the same manner
            as any <code>files</code> would be with respect to the
            <code>image</code>.

          <h4 id="environment.image">image
            <small class="text-muted">optional: string</small></h4>
  <p>
    The complete &uuml;ber-solution to specifying an operating environment
    for building or executing student code is to provide a container
    image, similar to the solution used by
    <a href="https://gradescope-autograders.readthedocs.io/">gradescope</a>.
    PEML allows for environments to be specified in the form of container
    images, although whether this feature is supported is tool-dependent.
  </p>

          <p>
            The <code>image</code> key for an environment identifies
            a specific docker image that encapsulates the environment.
            We choose docker for this, because it's easy and ubiquitous,
            although if anyone has clear ideas about how we can provide
            broader support here, please suggest!
      The docker container image can be specified by using a docker image
      identifier, optionally including a docker image repository and/or tag
      (basically, anything that can be used to specify a container image to a
      <code>docker run</code> command). 
          </p>

  <p>
    If an <code>image</code> is specified for the environment, this
    parameter can be used to specify the docker image registry where
    the image can be pulled.

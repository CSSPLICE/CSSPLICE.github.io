  <h2 id="intro">Describing Exercises through Tagging</h2>
  <p>
    This page describes the basics of tagging to label/categorize/describe
    exercises. While tagging isn't intended to be hard or to require
    specialized skill, some structure does provide added benefit to users
    who want to find or understand exercises. Authors who don't intend to
    share their PEML descriptions could omit tags entirely, since tags are
    optional. However, the information provided here is intended to allow
    authors who wish to provide descriptive information about their
    exercises to aid other users.
  </p>

<section>
  <h2 id="basics">Basic Structure Common to All Tags</h2>
  <p>
    All tags are provided as part of a nested dictionary structure rooted
    at the <code>tag</code> key.
  </p>
  <p>
    The general content of all the tagging fields is the same: a
    tag list is simply a sequence of strings. For convenience, lists of
    tags can be written as a single text value, with tags separated by
    delimiters. We recommend the use of semicolons as the most flexible
    delimiter choice for authors, since semicolons provide support for
    a wide range of tag styles and give maximum tool compatibility (for example,
    supporting multi-word tags, or even tag phrases that include commas):
  </p>
{% highlight peml %}
tag.topics: strings; loops; conditions
{% endhighlight %}
  <p>
    While we recommend the use of semicolons, tools should be more flexible
    in order to provide a more human-friendly authoring experience. If a
    tag string contains semicolons, then semicolons should be used as
    delimiters. Otherwise, if a tag string contains commas, then commas should
    be used as delimiters instead. In all cases, leading and trailing whitespace
    should be trimmed from individual tags in the list.
  </p>
{% highlight peml %}
# The preferred form:
tag.topics: strings; loops; conditions

# But this version means the same thing
tag.topics: strings, loops, conditions
{% endhighlight %}
  <p>
    For even greater control (or for tools generating descriptions), the
    ArchieML approach of defining an array of strings can even be used. Every
    tag list can be written as a single semicolon-delimited (or comma-delimited)
    string, or formulated as an array of strings:
  </p>
{% highlight peml %}
# More verbose array encoding, but equivalent
[tag.topics]
* strings
* loops
* conditions
[]
{% endhighlight %}

  <section>
    <h3 id="tag.topics" data-toc-title="tag.topics">tag.topics
      <small class="text-muted">optional: string or array</small></h3>

    <p><span class="badge badge-secondary">Schema:</span></p>
{% highlight json %}
"topics": { "oneOf": [
  { "type": "string", "minLength": 1 },
  {
    "type": "array",
    "items": { "type": "string", "minLength": 1 },
    "minItems": 1
  }
  ]}
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
      The <code>tag.topics</code> tag list specifies the topic(s) that are
      the focus of the exercise--that is, what topic(s) or skill(s) is the
      learner supposed to be practicing in this exercise. This list is
      not intended to include topics the learner is supposed to already
      know or have mastered in order for them to understand the exercise
      in the first place.
    </p>
    <p>
      For topic vocabulary, we encourage authors to use commonly used terms
      such as those that typically appear in textbooks associated with
      the kinds of courses the exercise is targeting, or terms taken from
      the <a href="https://www.acm.org/education/curricula-recommendations">ACM
      Computing Curricula</a> guidelines (such as the topics listed in the
      body of knowledge in <a href="https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/education/cs2013_web_final.pdf">CS2013</a>).

  <h2 id="topics">Describing Prerequisite Knowledge</h2>

  <section>
    <h3 id="tag.prerequisites" data-toc-title="tag.prerequisites">tag.prerequisites
      <small class="text-muted">optional: string or array or object</small></h3>

    <p><span class="badge badge-secondary">Schema:</span></p>
{% highlight json %}
"prerequisites": { "oneOf": [
  { "$ref": "tag_list" },
  {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "exposure": { "$ref": "tag_list" },
      "familiarity": { "$ref": "tag_list" },
      "mastery": { "$ref": "tag_list" }
    }
  }
]}
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
      The <code>tag.prerequisites</code> tag list specifies the topic(s) that
      a learner is expected to already know in order to approach this exercise.
      In other words, this tag covers topics that enable the student to
      understand this exercise or its solution, but that are not the focus
      of this exercise--instead, simply prerequisite materials that enable
      the student to exercise the target knowledge/skills here.
    </p>
    <p>
      If desired, an author can be more specific about the level of prior
      knowledge needed in prerequisite topics. To do this, rather than
      specifying tags using <code>tag.prerequisites</code>, the author can
      use one or more of three nested keys.
    </p>

    "minItems": 1
  }
  ]}
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
      The <code>tag.prerequisites.exposure</code> tag list is an optional
      way to be more specific about prerequisite knowledge or skills. Here,
      we're using a 3-category partitioning of how well a learner has mastered
      a topic by characterizing it in terms of exposure, familiarity, or
      mastery. A learner is said to have <strong>exposure to</strong> a topic
      if they have heard the term and/or seen the procedure, but may not be
      able to discuss or use it effectively without further instruction.
      This represents a weak level of background knowledge.

      we're using a 3-category partitioning of how well a learner has mastered
      a topic by characterizing it in terms of exposure, familiarity, or
      mastery. A learner is said to have <strong>familiarity with</strong> a
      topic if they can
      answer questions about or use the material/procedure, even in a new
      context, when instructed to do so.
      This represents a medium level of background knowledge.

      topic if they exhibit knowledge of or skill with the material/procedure,
      even in a new context, and even when not instructed to do so.
      This represents a high level of background knowledge.

  <p>
  In addition to tags about topic areas, tags can also be used in other
  ways to label exercises for various purposes, as described here. For
  labeling exercises by difficulty, see the
  <a href="exercise.html#difficulty">difficulty key</a>.

  }
  ]}
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
      The <code>tag.style</code> tag list specifies the "style" of exercise.
      Suggested values include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>code-writing</li>
      <li>multiple-choice</li>
      <li>fill-in-the-blank</li>
      <li>bug-identification</li>
      <li>bug-fixing</li>
      <li>symbolic-execution (e.g., predicting the output)</li>
      <li>project</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <span class="badge badge-warning">Note:</span> This list is likely
      to be incomplete, so ideas for a more complete list, or more standardized
      terms for these exercise styles, are definitely welcome.

    "minItems": 1
  }
  ]}
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
      The <code>tag.course</code> tag list is used to indicate the course(s)
      associated with this exercise, if any. This could include anything from
      fairly general categories of courses ("cs1" or "programming languages")
      to specific institutional course numbers, or any combination.

  {
    "type": "array",
    "items": { "type": "string", "minLength": 1 },
    "minItems": 1
  }
  ]}
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
      The <code>tag.book</code> tag list is used to indicate the textbook(s)
      associated with this exercise, if any. While exercises or programming
      projects that are taken directly from a textbook (or a textbook's
      associated question bank or lab manual) should already provide this
      information in the
      <a href="exercise.html#license.book">license.book key</a>,
      the <code>tag.book</code> is more broadly applicable to independently-authored
      exercises that use materials/examples associated with a book or that
      expect the learner to have access to a book, even if they are not
      owned by the same copyright owner as the book itself.

    "minItems": 1
  }
  ]}
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
      The <code>tag.personal</code> tag list is used to indicate personal
      tags that may only be meaningful to the original author/tagger, and
      are used for personal recall/categorization purposes. Values here may
      not be as relevant for other users.

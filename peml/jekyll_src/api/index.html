    <h2>PEML parser as a microservice</h2>
    <p>Our goal when designing the PEML parser was to ensure the parsing capabilities 
        could be offered to tools build using different languages and frameworks. 
        While the parser exists as a Ruby gem,providing it as a library for different 
        programming languages in use would be a mammoth task.</p>
    
    <p>It was thuse decided to offer the parsing capabilities through a Rest API.
        The Rails application that offers this functionality provides it in two flavours:
        a GET request that lets users send encoded PEML descriptions and a POST request 
        that lets users send PEML descriptions as files.

    <h2>Examples of how to access the API with common programming languages</h2>
    <h3>Java</h3>
    <p>We can use the HttpRequest and HttpResponse classes offered by the java.net package.
        ObjectMapper has been used to map a PEML payload to JSON String which is our request body.
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            String TARGET = "https://skynet.cs.vt.edu/peml-live/api/parse";
            String requestBody = objectMapper.writeValueAsString(values);

            URI uri = new URI(TARGET);
            HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder(uri)
                    .header("Content-Type", "application/json")
                    .timeout(Duration.ofMillis(3000))
                    .POST(HttpRequest.BodyPublishers.ofString(requestBody))
                    .build();

            HttpResponse<String> response = HttpClient.newHttpClient()
                    .send(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString());
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>The variable "values" being parsed to a JSON string is essentially a map containing
        arguments for the parser. The request cannot be made without the "peml" argument being
        set however extra functionality in the form of variable substitution and automatic html
        rendering is provided too. Following is an example of how you would generate "values" form
        an XHTML/HTML page
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            String peml = request.getParameter("peml");
            String interpolate = request.getParameter("interpolate")!=null?"true":"false";
            String html = request.getParameter("html")!=null?"true":"false";

            Map<String, String> values = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();

            values.put("peml", peml);
            values.put("output_format", "json");
            values.put("interpolate", "true");
            values.put("render_to_html", "true");
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h3>Python</h3>
    <p>For python, we can simply use the requests library that offers both get and post methods.
        The returned response can then be extracted as json and operated upon.
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            import requests
            peml = "your peml description goes here"
            query = {"peml": peml, "output_format": "json"}
            response = requests.get("https://skynet.cs.vt.edu/peml-live/api/parse", params = query)
            print(response.json())
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h3>JavaScript</h3>
    <p>For JavaScript, much akin to python, we use the Fetch API to get a response. It must be noted however
        that the Fetch API is not supported by IE11. Following is an example of hot to access the API using
        JavaScript. You will probably need to embed the script in a page that collects user input. 
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
              const url = "https://skynet.cs.vt.edu/peml-live/api/parse"
              const payload = {"peml": "peml/text", "output_format": "json", "render_to_html": "true"}

              $(.btn).click(function(){
                  $.post(url, data, function(data, status){
                      console.log(data)
                  });
              })
        </code>
    </pre>

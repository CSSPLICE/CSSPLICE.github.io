<section>
  <h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
  <p>The <b>Programming Exercise Markup Language (PEML)</b> is intended
  to be a simple, easy format for
  CS and IT instructors of all kinds (college, community college, high
  school, whatever) to describe programming assignments and activities.
  We want it to be so easy (and obvious) to use that instructors won't
  see it as a technological or notational barrier to expressing their
  assignments.
  </p><p>
  We intend for this format to be something that authors of automated
  grading tools can adopt, so they can provide a very easy, low-energy
  onboarding path for existing instructors to get programming activities
  into such tools. As a result, this notation leans heavily on supporting
  authors and streamlining common cases, even if this may require more
  work on the part of tool developers--the goal is to make it super easy
  for <b>authors</b> of programming activities, not to fit into a specific
  auto-grader or simplify tasks for tool writers.
  </p>
  <p>PEML is designed to achieve the following goals:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Minimal learning curve</li>
    <li>Plain-text file representation</li>
    <li>Supports references to external resources</li>
    <li>Directory-structured organization of associated assets</li>
    <li>Zip file packaging of multi-file assets with description</li>
    <li>Programming language neutral</li>
    <li>Minimal technology support</li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="format">Basic Format</h2>
  <p>The remainder of this description is split into two main parts:
  first, the format for describing key/value pairs (in this section), and
  second, the data model (on the following pages). We view these two
  as independent. As indicated in the <a href="about.html#whynot">Why Not
  YAML?</a>, we view the data described for a programming assignment
  as directly representable in PEML, YAML, JSON, etc. We also expect
  that most tools will support either YAML or JSON directly for tooling
  purposes, and that conversions between PEML&nbsp;&lt;=&gt;&nbsp;YAML or
  PEML&nbsp;&lt;=&gt;&nbsp;JSON will be easy (In fact, we already have
  a <a href="https://skynet.cs.vt.edu/peml-live/api">REST service</a>
  that will do it for you!). So users who strongly
  prefer an alternate notation can probably freely use one. However, we
  strongly believe that a representation optimized for human authoring
  of structured text consisting primarily of many multi-line text values
  is warranted to make authoring easier for those who don't think/write
  in YAML or JSON regularly.</p>
  <p>OK, on to the format itself.</p>

instructions:----------
Write a program that reads a single string (in the form of one line
of text) from its standard input, and determines whether the string is
a _palindrome_. A palindrome is a string that reads the same way
backward as it does forward, such as "racecar" or "madam". Your
program does not need to prompt for its input, and should only generate
one line of output, in the following
format:

```
"racecar" is a palindrome.
```

Or:

```
"Flintstone" is not a palindrome.
```

{% endhighlight %}
  
  <p>PEML uses a plain-text representation for
  describing exercises.  This format is designed to be easy to edit in a
  plain text editor. It is based on <a href="http://archieml.org/">ArchieML</a>,
  with a few minor modifications.</p>

  <h3 id="kv-pairs">Want to Start with a Tutorial?</h3>
  <p>If you'd rather dive in and learn PEML by following a tutorial,
  then start here:</p>

  <p><a href="tutorial.html">Tutorial: Get Started Writing PEML</a>!</p>

  <h3 id="kv-pairs">Key/Value Pairs</h3>
  <p>Like YAML, we describe a programming exercise as a series of
  key/value pairs. Wow, big deal.</p>
  <p>In YAML terms, that means the top-level structure of an exercise is a
  <b>mapping</b> (a hash or dictionary).</p>
  <p>Keys are alphanumeric identifiers (starting with
  a letter, and including underscores). This is more restrictive than YAML,
  but the more general idea of allowing any representable value to be a key
  has little utility here and requires more careful parsing and fancier
  quoting rules that only decrease writability and increase the potential
  learning curve ... so, PEML uses the simpler notion that is common in
  many programming language identifier token classes. Note that periods
  can be used to form dotted names to refer to nested keys, as in
  ArchieML.</p>
  <p>Also as in ArchieML, each key must start at the beginning of a line and
  be followed by a colon (for single-valued keys; keys that map to
  collections will instead be either: (a) surrounded by square brackets,
  or (b) surrounded by curly braces, still following ArchieML).</p>
  <p>The corresponding value follows the colon. All values are potentially
  multi-lined values, and extend up to the beginning of the next property.
  Any leading/trailing white space is trimmed (including newlines), and
  multi-line values (i.e., those containing embedded newline(s) after
  trimming) are automatically terminated with a single newline. As a result
  blank lines can appear immediately before any key (or before any unquoted
  value) for visual spacing/chunking as desired without affecting the
  meaning.
  </p>
  <p>
  Like ArchieML, PEML is intended to be parsed line by line, with the first
  non-whitespace sequence on the line determining its role. A simple,
  line-oriented parsing strategy using a basic state machine should be
  sufficient, without requiring complex grammar-based parsing strategies.</p>

  <h3 id="comments">Comments</h3>
  <p>PEML allows single-line comments using the <code>#</code> character,
  as in YAML. The # character must be the first (non-whitespace) character
  on the line (i.e., only whole-line comments are supported), and the
  corresponding line is completely ignored for the purposes of interpreting
  the meaning of the PEML. Any line beginning with a # character (and any
  leading indentation) is interpreted as a comment line, except in quoted
  values.</p>
  
  <p>
  Inspired by YAML's document start and end markers, PEML uses a specific
  comment line ("#---", a pound sign followed by three dashes) to signal
  the start of a PEML description. This marker is optional for the first
  PEML description in a text stream, but serves as the delimiter between
  exercises if multiple PEML descriptions are presented in a single file
  or stream. The current PEML description continues until the next occurrence
  of this marker (signaling the beginning of a new exercise), or the end
  of input.
  </p>

  <h3 id="quoting">Quoting</h3>    
  <p>
  On occasion, one may end up including text as part of a value that
  might also be recognizable as the start of a key. You can see this where
  the word "<code>format:</code>" appears in the example above, as part
  of the value given for the key "<code>instructions:</code>". In those
  cases, PEML uses a variant of
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_document">HereDoc</a>-style
  syntax, adapted to be more like triple quotes in languages like Python,
  Scala, R, etc.:
  </p>
{% highlight peml %}
some_key:"""
You can put any multi-line text inside
here and it is treated as if it is
quoted: even when it contains things
that: look
like: keys and values.
"""
{% endhighlight %}
  <p>Any key where the colon is immediately followed by three or more
  repetitions of the same printing character is treated as having a
  HereDoc-style quoted value, with the provided sequence of repeated
  characters serving as the delimiter. This is more flexible than
  triple-quoting, since triple quotes themselves may appear in program
  fragments for exercises using particular programming languages. This
  technique allows authors to choose a custom delimiter (as with HereDocs),
  but allows them to use repeated punctuation symbols to provide a more
  identifiable/scannable horizontal delimiter around the value, rather
  than using a custom identifier.</p>
  <p>As with HereDocs in many programming languages, the quoted value
  is terminated by the first subsequent occurrence of a line containing
  only the delimiter character sequence.</p>

{% highlight peml %}
yet_another_key:~~~~~
You can use any printable character as the delimiter,
as long as it is repeated at least three times. The ending
delimiter must exactly match the starting one, and appear
on its own line with no indentation.

Of course, using a punctuation symbol such as -, =, ~, +, etc.,
is encouraged, and use of letters or digits is discouraged
since it may reduce readability.
~~~~~
{% endhighlight %}

  <p>Of course, many programming languages also use <code>#</code> as a
  comment character.
  In PEML, <code>#</code> has no special meaning inside a quoted value.
  As a result, we recommend HereDoc-quoting any values that contain source
  code from such a programming language, to prevent a program's comment lines
  from being interpreted as PEML comments.</p>

  <h3 id="embedding-markup">Embedding Markdown (and HTML)</h3>
  <p>Special formatting in the textual description of the
  exercise can be written using
  <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/">Markdown</a>,
  which also supports embedding HTML directly in exercise descriptions.
  So use Markdown or HTML for adding formatting to your text. Plain,
  unformatted text also works, when no special formatting markup is
  desired. Here, we specify git's flavor of markdown.</p>
  <p>
  <span class="badge badge-warning">Note:</span>
  It is easy to consider adding a key for <code>text_format:</code>,
  specifying markdown as the default but allowing individual users to
  use other markup formats (such as reStructuredText, AsciiDoc, POD,
  LaTeX, etc.). In fact, this is already blocked out in the
  <code>options.text_format</code> field within the data model, although it
  needs more refinement.
  </p>
  <p>
  <span class="badge badge-warning">Another Note:</span> Actually, by using
  <a href="https://pandoc.org/">pandoc</a> and a PEML parsing wrapper, it
  should be possible to create a web service that can read
  a PEML document using a wide variety of text markup formats and render
  any of them to HTML, including reStructuredText,
  many dialects of markdown, many wiki markup languages, Docbook, LaTeX,
  and even Microsoft Word docx files (!). Unfortunately, this doesn't
  address AsciiDoc :-(. At this point, it is plausible to consider supporting
  other markup formats along with the <code>options.text_format:</code>
  key if community effort can generate the necessary support for adopting
  tools to make use of it (i.e., adding support under the <code>render</code>
  option of our <a href="https://skynet.cs.vt.edu/peml-live/api">PEML REST
  micro-service</a>).
  </p>

<section>
  <h2 id="additional">Additional Structuring Features</h2>
  <h3 id="urls">External Resources</h3>
  <p>
  External resources might be referenced in two different ways in PEML.
  First, for any key/value pair, the value to the right of the colon
  can be provided by using an external reference, rather than by
  providing the value directly in the PEML file. Values that are provided
  externally can be expressed as absolute or relative URLs using the
  "<code>url(...)</code>" construct (similar to its use in CSS).
  </p>

{% highlight peml %}
# An example of an external resource
instructions: url(some/directory/assignment.pdf)
{% endhighlight %}

  <p>While we strongly discourage the use of PDF assignment descriptions,
  any key value can be farmed out into an external file (or directory of
  files!). This approach might be most
  used for source code content stored in separate files, test data stored
  in separate files, code libraries, and so on.
  </p>
  <p>Here, an absolute URL would specify the web location of the resource,
  while a relative URL would be resolved <em>relative to the location of
  the PEML file containing it</em>. As discussed above under
  <a href="about.html#design">Design Goals</a>, if a PEML description
  is packaged
  in a zip file so that other resources can be transferred along with it,
  relative URLs could be used to refer to other contents within the zip
  file. Similarly, PEML files stored on local disk could refer to local
  files stored adjacently, and PEML files stored in git repositories or
  other systems could use the same technique.
  </p>
  <p>
  Second, it is likely that some embedded Markdown or HTML content
  (such as the <code>instructions</code> for the exercise) may include
  HTML tags that use relative or absolute URLs. This may be appropriate for
  referring to images, downloadable resources accessible to the student,
  etc. While authors can use absolute URLs in these contexts, it may be
  preferable in some circumstances to bundle those resources along with
  the PEML description. By convention, we encourage authors to place
  such files in a directory called <code>public_html/</code> that is
  located alongside the PEML file in the same folder, zip file, or
  repository. Within Markdown or HTML keys, relative URLs that start
  with "<code>public_html/...</code>" will then be correctly resolved to
  these resources. By adhering to this convention, tools can immediately
  determine that external web-accessible resources must also be provided
  and also be able to systematically rewrite URLs for user presentation.
  </p>
  <p>
  Third, it is plausible that feedback generated when processing
  author-provided reference tests may wish to use similar relative
  URLs to point to images or other resources included as part of the
  feedback. Again, any such resources should be placed in the
  <code>public_html/</code> folder.
  </p>
  <p>
  <span class="badge badge-warning">Note:</span> We are considering using
  a "convention over configuration" approach to saying that when a PEML
  exercise is bundled with files into a single zip, contents for
  nested keys can be provided implicitly by placing files under relative
  pathnames that mirror the key structure. Path segments that correspond
  to array indices can be taken from the <code>name</code>, <code>title</code>,
  or <code>language</code> key (in that preferred order) of the dictionary
  items inside the array, or numeric suffices can be used as path names.
  This could be particularly useful for adding files in places where
  file-based content is desirable (<code>src</code> and <code>environment</code>
  keys, for example, or anywhere a <code>.files</code> nested key appears).
  Avoiding the requirement that external files co-located with the PEML
  description be explicitly declared inside the PEML is more desirable in
  these cases. We need to work up some examples, though, and a more precise
  description of what the implicit mapping is. A short example: a
  <code>public_html/</code> folder located alongside the PEML file can
  implicitly be interpreted as the set of resources/files attached to the
  instructions, without requiring a redundant line inside the PEML itself
  saying: "<code>public_html: url(public_html)</code>"
  </p>


  <h3 id="conventions">Convention Over Configuration</h3>
  <p>
  While all of the settings and resources associated with an exercise can
  be directly embedded inside the PEML file itself, often it is easier to
  provide file-like content as, well, separate files. While you can explicitly
  list files as external references using the <code>url(...)</code> operator,
  it is often easier and simpler to just provide files "alongside" the
  PEML description as separate files themselves. To support this, PEML uses
  a convention for naming subdirectories to locate sets of files (which can
  always be overridden using an explicit <code>url(...)</code> expression as
  the value for the file set).
  </p>
  <p>
  For example, the <code>instructions</code> in an exercise might need to
  refer to external images. The PEML format also provides a 
  <code>public_html</code> key to refer to a set of files that are intended
  to be public web resources referenced in the <code>instructions</code>.
  Relative path names for images and links inside the <code>instructions</code>
  refer to file resources in the <code>public_html</code> file set. While
  all of these files could be explicitly listed, if no <code>public_html</code>
  key is provided in the PEML description, then <strong>by convention</strong>
  the subdirectory with the same name as this key "<code>public_html/"
  located alongside/adjacent to this PEML description (for example, packaged
  in the same zip file, or located in the same directory/folder) is
  assumed to contain the files in the <code>public_html</code> file set.
  </p>
  <p>
  Similarly, instead of specifying a <code>src.starter.files</code> file set,
  the author can just place files in the <code>src/starter</code>
  subdirectory adjacent to the PEML source (for any key representing a file set
  with a name ending in ".files", that suffix is omitted from the corresponding
  directory name). In most cases, we envision that
  authors will generally provide external resources by convention, rather than
  explicitly specifying them. In cases where the same set of physical files
  will be shared across multiple exercises, explicit <code>url(...)</code>
  locations can be used to refer to shared file sets without a huge effort.
  Placing these in a PEML fragment and using the <code>:include</code>
  directive (discussed in the next section) may also be useful.
  </p>


  <h3 id="includes">Splitting Up PEML Descriptions</h3>
  <p>
  In addition to allowing individual key values to be provided in external
  files, PEML adds an <code>:include</code> directive that allows parts of
  the PEML description to be included from another external location. While
  this directive is not strictly necessary, it might be used by some
  authors to factor out repeated key/value pairs (for the <code>license</code>,
  <code>author</code>, environment definitions, etc.) so they can be written
  once and reused across multiple PEML descriptions without repeating the
  content.
  </p>

{% highlight peml %}
# An example of an external resource
:include url(some/directory/cc-sa-license.peml)
{% endhighlight %}

  <p>
  Another use for <code>:include</code> is to allow an author to separate
  out the definition of the test cases and test environment for an exercise
  so they are placed in a separate file. This might be useful so that the
  exercise description itself might be public/accessible, but the test cases
  or grading criteria applied to the exercise are managed separately and
  only available to some users.
  </p>

  <h3 id="interpolation">String Interpolation with Variable Values</h3>
  <p>
  <strong>Note: it is possible that some tools may choose not to implement
  this feature, since it has to do with <em>use</em> of exercises as
  opposed to simply parsing PEML descriptions.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
  In some cases, authors may wish to write "parameterized" exercise
  descriptions where many instances of the exercise can be produced using
  different parameter values. For example, a parameterized exercise may
  allow for individualized or unique instances of the exercise to be
  programmatically generated on demand for each new user/student. To
  allow for tools that support such features, PEML allows for parameterized
  contents in instructions, tests, code, etc.
  </p>
  <p>
  PEML uses <a href="https://mustache.github.io/">mustache-compatible</a>
  notation for string interpolation, which is also compatible with a number
  of templating systems. It is analogous to Ruby's <code>#{...}</code> string
  interpolation syntax, Python's string interpolation syntax, and similar to
  using braces in string interpolation in Perl. For any exercise, the
  author can use any desired number of user-defined variables, and
  any occurrences of {% raw %}<code>{{<em>variable-name</em>}}</code>{% endraw %}
  in the title,
  instructions, <code>src</code> code assets, or test <code>suites</code>
  will be substituted when an
  instance of the exercise is needed.
  </p>
  <p>{% raw %}
  Since different tools implementing PEML may use different templating
  implementations to achieve interpolation, extensions or variants of
  {{mustache}} syntax might be supported, so check your tool's documentation
  when in doubt.
  {% endraw %}</p>

{% highlight peml %}
instructions:
{% raw %}Draw a square that is {{width}} pixels wide by {{height}} pixels tall.
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

  <p>{% raw %}
  PEML does not support escaping of literal "{{" and "}}" marking interpolated
  values (although PEML-supporting tools may support custom notational
  extensions that allow this, it isn't part of the PEML definition).
  PEML authors
  are then advised to ensure that if their instructions or code use
  <code>{{...}}</code> notation, they keep the variable names used for
  substitution in
  the PEML description disjoint from those appearing natively in the text.
  Where necessary, use the
  <a href="schema/exercise.html#options.interpolation.delimiters">options.interpolation.delimiters</a>
  key to set the delimiters to something different (similar to the
  mustache <a href="https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html">set
  delimiter</a> feature).
  The
  <a href="schema/exercise.html#options.interpolation.enable">options.interpolation.enable</a>
  key can be used to enable/disable interpolation if necessary (default is
  enabled, for tools that support this feature).
  {% endraw %}</p>

  <h3 id="structure">Nested Structure</h3>
  <p>
  Beyond these basics, nested properties follow Archie's conventions for
  dotted keys (nested key structure), object blocks, and arrays. The main
  differences here compared to ArchieML is the use of multi-line values
  by default, the use of a HereDoc/triple-quote hybrid rather than a
  specific end marker with escaping of special characters when a delimiter
  is necessary, and support for comments.</p>

As in ArchieML, an array is signified with a key enclosed in square brackets

pairs) at the end of the file to be omitted, but all closing array delimiters
have been included here for clarity.
</p>
<p>
As in YAML and JSON, structures can be arbitrarily nested in PEML. Array keys
that start with a period (<code>.</code>) are used to indicate arrays
nested inside other arrays (from ArchieML).

  "instructions": "Write a program that reads a single string (in the form of one line\nof text) from its standard input, and determines whether the string is\na _palindrome_. A palindrome is a string that reads the same way\nbackward as it does forward, such as "racecar" or "madam". Your\nprogram does not need to prompt for its input, and should only generate\none line of output, in the following\nformat:\n\n&lt;pre&gt;\n"racecar" is a palindrome.\n&lt;/pre&gt;\n\nOr:\n\n&lt;pre&gt;\n"Flintstone" is not a palindrome.\n&lt;/pre&gt;\n",

title: About PEML
---

<section>
  <h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
  <p>The <b>Programming Exercise Markup Language (PEML)</b> 
  is intended to be a simple, easy format for
  CS and IT instructors of all kinds (college, community college, high
  school, whatever) to describe programming assignments and activities.
  We want it to be so easy (and obvious) to use that instructors won't
  see it as a technological or notational barrier to expressing their
  assignments.
  </p><p>
  We intend for this format to be something that authors of automated
  grading tools can adopt, so they can provide a very easy, low-energy
  onboarding path for existing instructors to get programming activities
  into such tools. As a result, this notation leans heavily on supporting
  authors and streamlining common cases, even if this may require more
  work on the part of tool developers--the goal is to make it super easy
  for <b>authors</b> of programming activities, not to fit into a specific
  auto-grader or simplify tasks for tool writers.
  </p>
  <p>OK, so this is a new notation. That sucks. But there doesn't seem to
  be an obvious alternative that meets our goals, so ...</p>
  <p>
  Also, in terms of scope of "programming activity", here we are trying
  to capture everything from very small programming activities, such as
  "here's a very short function, fill in the blank to make it work", to
  very large programming activities, such as "write dozens of classes
  spanning thousands of lines of code to implement this programming
  language", or whatever. Yes, that is a very broad range, but the aim
  is to cover the full range, rather than making simplifying assumptions
  that limit PEML to a narrower subset. The reason for using "Exercise"
  in the name of the language is to remind developers that it covers a
  broader range of activities than what many instructors see as pure
  "programming assignments".</p>

  <h2 id="whynot">Why not YAML? or JSON?</h2>
  <p>Actually, one of our design goals is for PEML descriptions to be
  directly mappable to YAML <i>and</i> JSON, so that people who prefer
  one of those notations (or tools that use those notations) can use
  the data model. Converting PEML to YAML or JSON should be a direct/easy
  tool translation that we expect will be provided as a service and/or
  library at some point.</p>
  <p>But why not just use YAML (or JSON) directly, since parsers already
  exist?</p>
  <p>The main reasons are:</p>
  <ol type="a">
    <li><p>These existing formats are not <b>writer-friendly enough</b> for
    descriptions that contain large amounts of free-form text. Face it,
    programming activities usually require
    large-ish chunks of multi-line text to describe most of the interesting
    properties, whether you're talking about the specification for a program,
    or starter code to provide to a student, or reference tests to check a
    solution, or a sample/reference solution to provide for other instructors
    to look at, or whatever. In most cases, PEML is not about simple
    key/value pairs where values are small pieces of data, or about deeply
    structured nested object descriptions. It's about writer-friendly input
    of structured text where most of the values are multi-line text written
    by humans.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Are not <b>syntax-friendly enough</b> to present a minimal-effort
    entry path. Of course, this isn't an obstacle for programming-oriented
    instructors who have already used YAML (or JSON) and are familiar with
    working with them. However, the sticky bits of those formats do require
    a small learning curve that we hope to minimize further.</p>
    <p>
    In particular, YAML's reliance on whitespace/indentation to indicate
    nested structure can pose an obstacle to more free-form text input.
    JSON's reliance on JavaScript quoting and lack of true multi-line values
    makes it challenging for these tasks in similar ways.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p> Of course, other practitioners have made the same complaints about both
  YAML and JSON before, so "more human-friendly" alternatives to both
  formats have been proposed by others (see
  <a href="#influences">Influences</a> below). Naturally, we were unable to
  find an existing format that exactly met the needs here ... If you happen
  to know of one we've overlooked that would be a better fit, please say
  so! What we are aiming for is a format that allows instructors to
  copy-and-paste content from existing sources (existing assignment writeups,
  program solutions, program text, whatever) with minimal additional
  reformatting work in order to create a readable, streamlined programming
  exercise representation.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2 id="design">Design Goals</h2>
  <p>OK, with the context for this description language out of the way,
  here are the specific objectives we are hoping to achieve:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p><b>Minimal learning curve</b>:
    To paraphrase Cay Horstmann, we are aiming for a format that an average
    computing instructor can learn in under an hour. Further, after a little
    practice, we hope that an instructor who has an existing assignment can
    convert or map it to this representation in less than 10 minutes. We
    want the syntax to be super simple/direct, so that instructors can focus
    just on the specific properties they are describing.
    </p></li>

    <li><p><b>Plain-text file representation</b>:
    PEML uses a plain-text format so that it is easy to edit with any text
    editor. As mentioned above, we want instructors to be able to directly
    copy plain-text content, including relevant code assets or instructions,
    right into the PEML representation. For straightforward assignments
    that do not require any external resources or a special execution
    enviroment setup, the entire description can be written in one simple
    text file. Only instructors with more advanced situations or requirements
    need to use PEML's facility to connect with external resources.
    </p></li>

    <li><p><b>Reference to external resources</b>:
    While the central representation for an exercise is a text file, we
    recognize than instructors may run into situations where one or more
    supporting resources are also necessary for a given exercise (such as
    custom data files, a special library, existing PDF documents, etc.).
    PEML provides a clean way for specifying values through relative and
    absolute URLs. These URLs may refer to remote resources (located online,
    including in git repositories or other locations, docker containers,
    etc.), or local resources located alongside the PEML file.
    </p></li>

    <li><p><b>Directory structure</b>:
    While exercises described as a single text file are easy to transport
    and process, sometimes it may be useful for an exercise to refer to
    external resources stored locally. This can be done by including
    relative URLs in the exercise description (see below). In this situation,
    we can view the subdirectory containing the PEML file as the root of
    an exercise description, with relative URLs referring to other file
    paths within that subdirectory (or subdirectory tree). This allows a
    single PEML file along with its associated local resources to be
    managed as a single local entity.
    </p></li>

    <li><p><b>Zip file packaging</b>:
    Similarly, while a PEML file plus its associated local resources can
    be represented as a subdirectory (or subdirectory tree), they can also
    be packaged into a zip file. The PEML file should be in the root of
    the zip file's internal directory structure, named
    <code>exercise.peml</code>. Relative URLs inside the PEML file will
    then be interpreted within the ZIP relative to the location of the
    PEML file (i.e., relative to the ZIP's root). This makes it easy to
    zip a subdirectory representing an exercise to make it easy to
    transport or upload the PEML file and all of the associated local
    resources, and also makes it easy to unzip a packaged exercise to
    produce a subdirectory representation.
    </p></li>

    <li><p>
    <b>Programming language neutral</b>: PEML should support descriptions
    of programming activities in any programming language, rather than
    being specific to just one. Some fields/assets within one exercise
    description will naturally be programming-language-specific, but the
    notation used to describe the exercise itself should not be.
    </p></li>

    <li><p><b>Minimal technology support</b>:
    Basic PEML descriptions do not require the use of any specific
    supporting technologies to manage build environments, execution
    environments, or external dependencies. This follows from the goal
    to use a simple text file representation (with no external resources)
    for basic programming activities similar to those found in many
    textbooks. We believe simple, low overhead assignments will be the
    most common case. However, we also realize that
    some exercise authors may prefer to use specific tools or technologies
    to package or compartmentalize execution environment features,
    supporting libraries, run-time dependencies, build environments,
    custom testing tools, etc. As a result, PEML is set up to allow such
    services to be used by exercise authors who desire it, but they
    are <i>not</i> required for mainstream (or simple) exercise
    descriptions. In other words, instructors who use "vanilla" assignments
    without any special tooling or infrastructure should be able to hop in
    and describe their existing exercises in PEML without having to learn
    about new tools or technologies.
    </p></li>

  <h2 id="influences">Influences</h2>
  <p>In terms of inspiration, PEML has been influenced heavily by YAML
  and its relatives (including HAML), as well as many alternative
  notations that have been developed as alternatives for describing
  structured textual data.</p>
  <p>One of the most prominent influences has been
  <a href="http://archieml.org/">ArchieML</a>, another format with some
  overlapping goals used by the New York Times to write certain types of
  online content. PEML reuses big chunks of ArchieML's design.</p>
  <p>The <a href="https://github.com/burningtree/awesome-json">Awesome
  JSON</a> page lists a nice collection of extensions to or alternatives
  to JSON that address some of the shortcomings of using it as a
  human-authored notation, including
  <a href="https://github.com/bevry/cson">CSON</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/apiaryio/mson">MSON</a>, and
  <a href="https://github.com/lightbend/config/blob/master/HOCON.md">HOCON</a>.
  Other languages like <a href="https://github.com/toml-lang/toml">TOML</a>
  and YAML variants have also influenced this design.
  </p>
  <p>
  Finally, the data model and some of the packaging ideas have been
  influenced by the work of an ITiCSE 2008 working group on the topic,
  which produced this report:
  <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/1473195.1473240"><i>Developing a Common
  Format for Sharing Programming Assignments</i></a>.

        Computing Science Education Infrastructure: From Tools to Data
      </h1>

      <p>
		The fifth SPLICE Project workshop will be held in Toronto, Canada on Sunday, August 11, 2019 in conjunction with ICER 2019.
      </p>
	    <p><b>Workshop Agenda</b>: The schedule for the workshop can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ws-p1s-8kpiklumn_sHQVDIX1ozfFfmZYz8z__izIGI/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>
	   <p>
		The progress in the field of computer science education to a large extent depends on our ability to introduce novel approaches and 
		tools to our students, collect data on student interaction with the tools, and analyze the data to learn from this experience. 
		The goal of SPLICE, an NSF-supported project and a community of researchers, is building an Infrastructure for Computer Science Education Research, 
		which could facilitate all stages of this process. The infrastructure should support (1) broader re-use of innovative learning content instrumented 
		for rich data collection, (2) extensive data collection from multiple learning tools in interoperable formats, (3) repositories to share and tools 
		for analysis of learner data, and (4) development of best practices in collecting, sharing, and processing learner data. 
	  </p>
	  
	    
	  <p>
		  <b>Call For Participation</b><br/>
		You are invited to attend the ICER 2019 SPLICE workshop. The primary goal of the workshop is to report progress, exchange information about best practices, 
		  and to build upon our existing collaborations developed over the course of the project to engage more members of the community in tasks that will advance 
		  the project agenda. The attendees will be able to learn about SPLICE goals and working groups, report their recent work related to SPLICE goals, and get 
		  engaged in the SPLICE Community work through working groups and funded collaborative projects. This NSF-supported workshop is the latest in a series of 
		  SPLICE workshops and is a follow-up to successful workshops at SIGCSE 2018, ICER 2018 and SIGCSE 2019 
		  (see <a href="https://cssplice.github.io">https://cssplice.github.io</a>). Attendance at the workshop is free of charge and a limited number of travel grants are available.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p><b>Call for Papers and Lightning Presentations:</b><br/>
		We are inviting prospective participants to submit 4-6-page short papers and 2-page lightning papers about their past and ongoing work related to CS Education Infrastructure. 
		All authors must submit an <b>abstract</b> by June 28, 2019 to <a href="https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=splice2019icer" target="_blank">easychair</a>. The complete paper or lightning talk should be uploaded in ACM SIGCSE format one week later on July 5th, 2019.
		We are specifically looking for papers about collaborations 
		and integrations in the spirit of the SPLICE project. So if you have a working collaboration where you are integrating software tools and/or smart content, or are sharing learner 
		analytics data analysis tools or data sets, then we would like to hear about it. Most valuable in the context of the workshop would be papers focusing on the following topics, 
		although all work related to the SPLICE goals will be considered.
		<ul>
			<li> Descriptions of "smart" learning tools or programming environments, which interact with students and collect interaction/performance data</li>
			<li> Case studies of collaboration where reproducible practices were used to integrate two or more data-producing learning tools from different institutions</li>
			<li>Descriptions of infrastructures that could collect and integrate data from multiple learning tools (e.g. forum posts, LMS activity, and programming data)</li>
			<li>Descriptions of shareable Computer Science (CS) datasets</li>
			<li>Descriptions of data mining/analytics approaches applied to specifically Computer Science datasets</li>
		</ul>
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	  The authors of accepted papers will be able to present their work in at the workshop as Short talks of 15-20 minutes and Lightning Talks of 10 minutes. 
	  The papers will be published online as a part of the Workshop Proceedings and will be publicized on the SPLICE project site.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
		If you are planning to submit a lightning talk or a poster proposal for the mainstream ICER conference (due â€‹Friday, June 7, 2019), 
		which also matches the topic of the workshop, you are welcome to submit the same proposal as a 2-pages lightning paper for the workshop consideration. 
		The decision for conference and workshop presentation are made independently. If your proposal will be accepted by both the conference and our workshop, 
		you will be able to present your work at both venues (and publish it in the ICER workshop proceedings).
	  </p>

        Building an Infrastructure for Computer Science Education Research and Practice at Scale
      </h1>

      <p>
        <b>The sixth SPLICE Project workshop will be held virually on
          Wednesday, August 12, 2020 from 9AM to 12PM in conjunction
          with ACM Learning at Scale conference L@S 2020.

      <p>
        The goal of this workshop is to bring together the existing community of researchers working on the 
        Infrastructure Design for Data-Intensive Research in Computer Science Education and a community of L@S researchers 
        focused on CS Education. While both communities share many similar goals and could greatly benefit from each other work, 
        the interaction between the communities is small. We hope that the workshop will be instrumental in bringing together 
        like-minded researchers from different communities, 
        establishing collaboration, and expanding the scope of the infrastructure project to address critical scaling issues.
      </p>

      <p>
        This workshop is organized by the SPLICE community (Standards, Protocols, and Learning Infrastructure for Computing Education) 
        in association with NSF-supported project Community-Building and Infrastructure Design for Data-Intensive Research in Computer Science Education. 
        It follows a sequence of the previous SPLICE and CSEDM workshops organized at 
        SIGCSE, EDM, AIED, ICER, and LAK conferences. More information about SPLICE and past workshops can be found at <a href="https://cssplice.github.io">https://cssplice.github.io</a>
      </p>

      <p><b>Important Dates</b><br/>
        <ul>

          <li>Notification of acceptance: August 3, 2020</li>
          <li>The final version of accepted papers: August 7, 2020</li>
          <li>The workshop: August 12, 2020</li>

      <p>
        <b>Call for Papers and Lightning Presentations</b><br/>
      <p>
        We are inviting prospective participants to submit 4-6-page short papers and 2-page “lightning” papers about their past and ongoing work related to 
        CS Education Infrastructure. We are especially interested in papers focused on collaborations, integrations, and re-use in the spirit of the SPLICE project. 
        So if you have a working collaboration where you are re-using and bringing together various software tools and/or smart content, or are sharing data sets or 
        learner analytics data analysis tools, then we would like to hear about it. Most valuable in the context of the workshop would be papers focusing on the following topics, 
        although all work related to the SPLICE goals will be considered.
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Descriptions of "smart" learning tools or programming environments, which interact with students and collect interaction/performance data</li>
          <li>Case studies of collaboration where reproducible practices were used to integrate two or more data-producing learning tools from different institutions</li>
          <li>Descriptions of infrastructures that could collect and integrate data from multiple learning tools (e.g. forum posts, LMS activity, and programming data)</li>
          <li>Descriptions of shareable Computer Science education datasets</li>
          <li>Descriptions of data mining/analytics approaches applied to specifically Computer Science datasets</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The authors of accepted papers will be able to present their work in at the workshop as Short talks of 15-20 minutes and Lightning Talks of 10 minutes. 
          The papers will be published online as a part of the Workshop Proceedings and will be publicized on the SPLICE project site.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have a contribution accepted to the mainstream L@K conference, which also matches the topic of the workshop, you are welcome to submit a 2-pages 
          lightning paper for the workshop consideration. It will help to publicize and discuss your work within a broader community.   
        </p>
      </p>

      <p>

        Building an Infrastructure for Computer Science Education Research and Practice at Scale
      </h1>

      <p>
		<b>The sixth SPLICE Project workshop will be held virually on Wednesday, August 12, 2020 from 9AM to 12PM in conjunction with ACM Learning at 
			Scale conference L@S 2020.</b>
      </p>

	   <p>
		The goal of this workshop is to bring together the existing community of researchers working on the 
		Infrastructure Design for Data-Intensive Research in Computer Science Education and a community of L@S researchers 
		focused on CS Education. While both communities share many similar goals and could greatly benefit from each other work, 
		the interaction between the communities is small. We hope that the workshop will be instrumental in bringing together 
		like-minded researchers from different communities, 
		establishing collaboration, and expanding the scope of the infrastructure project to address critical scaling issues.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		This workshop is organized by the SPLICE community (Standards, Protocols, and Learning Infrastructure for Computing Education) 
		in association with NSF-supported project Community-Building and Infrastructure Design for Data-Intensive Research in Computer Science Education. 
		It follows a sequence of the previous SPLICE and CSEDM workshops organized at 
		SIGCSE, EDM, AIED, ICER, and LAK conferences. More information about SPLICE and past workshops can be found at <a href="https://cssplice.github.io">https://cssplice.github.io</a>

		  <b>Call For Participation</b><br/>
			<p>
				The Workshop welcomes researchers who focus on the issues of computer science education at scale to contribute to the joint effort of designing and 
				building an infrastructure for data-intensive research in Computing Education. The infrastructure should support (1) broader reuse of innovative 
				learning content that is instrumented for rich data collection, (2) formats and tools for analysis of learner data, and (3) development of best 
				practices to make collections of learner data available to researchers.
			</p>

			<p>
				The workshop focus will be on how novel online learning tools inter-operate in the context of a large-scale educational process, 
				how learner data could be collected, integrated and processed at scale, and how data analysis approaches could be accumulated, 
				shared, and reused to improve education research efforts across the discipline and beyond. The organizers will introduce the goals of 
				SPLICE Community, report progress to date, present a range of relevant activities, and plan future collaboration. The attendees will 
				be able to share their relevant research, establish collaboration, get engaged in the SPLICE Community work, and obtain SPLICE 
				funding for collaborative research in the area.
			</p>
	  </p>

	  <p>
			<b>Call for Papers and Lightning Presentations</b><br/>

			<p>
				We are inviting prospective participants to submit 4-6-page short papers and 2-page “lightning” papers about their past and 
				ongoing work related to CS Education Infrastructure. We are especially interested in papers focused on collaborations, 
				integrations, and re-use in the spirit of the SPLICE project. So if you have a working collaboration where you are 
				re-using and bringing together various software tools and/or smart content, or are sharing data sets or learner analytics 
				data analysis tools, then we would like to hear about it. Most valuable in the context of the workshop would be papers focusing 
				on the following topics, although all work related to the SPLICE goals will be considered.

				<ul>
					<li>Descriptions of "smart" learning tools or programming environments, which interact with students and collect interaction/performance data</li>
					<li>Case studies of collaboration where reproducible practices were used to integrate two or more data-producing learning tools from different institutions</li>
					<li>Descriptions of infrastructures that could collect and integrate data from multiple learning tools (e.g. forum posts, LMS activity, and programming data)</li>
					<li>Descriptions of shareable Computer Science education datasets</li>
					<li>Descriptions of data mining/analytics approaches applied to specifically Computer Science datasets</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<p>
				The authors of accepted papers will be able to present their work at the workshop as Short talks of 15-20 minutes and Lightning 
				Talks of 10 minutes. The papers will be published online as a part of the Workshop Proceedings and will be publicized on the SPLICE project site.
			</p>

			<p>
				If you have a contribution accepted to the mainstream L@K conference, which also matches the topic of the workshop, you are welcome to submit a 
				2-pages lightning paper for the workshop consideration. It will help to publicize and discuss your work within a broader community.

        Building an Infrastructure for Computer Science Education Research and Practice at Scale
      </h1>

      <p>
		The sixth SPLICE Project workshop will be held virually on Wednesday, August 12, 2020 from 9AM to 12PM in conjunction with L@S 2020.
      </p>

	   <p>
		The goal of this workshop is to bring together the existing community of researchers working on the Infrastructure Design for Data-Intensive Research 
		in Computer Science Education and a community of L@S researchers focused on CS Education. While both  communities share many similar goals and could 
		greatly benefit from each other work, the interaction between the communities is small. We hope that the proposed workshop will be instrumental in 
		bringing together like-minded researchers from different communities, establishing collaboration, and expanding the scope of infrastructure project 
		to address critical scaling issues.

		  <b>Call For Participation</b><br/>
		This workshop is organized by the SPLICE community (Standards, Protocols, and Learning Infrastructure for Computing Education) in association with 
		NSF-supported project Community-Building and Infrastructure Design for Data-Intensive Research in Computer  Science Education. 
		It follows a sequence of previous SPLICE and CSEDM workshops organized at SIGCSE, EDM, AIED, ICER, and LAK conferences More information about 
		SPLICE and past workshops can be found at <a href="https://cssplice.github.io">https://cssplice.github.io</a>

			<p>
				The purpose of this workshop is to engage the community or researchers who focus on the issues of computer science education at scale 
				into the joint effort of designing and building an infrastructure for data-intensive research in Computing Education. 
				The infrastructure should support (1) broader reuse of innovative learning content that is instrumented for rich data collection, 
				(2) formats and tools for analysis of learner data, and (3) development of best practices to make collections of learner data available 
				to researchers.
			</p>

			<p>
				The workshop focus will be on how novel online learning tools inter-operate in the context of a large-scale educational process, 
				how learner data could be collected, integrated and processed at scale, and how data analysis approaches could be accumulated, shared, 
				and reused to improve education research efforts across the discipline and beyond. The organizers will introduce the goals of SPLICE Community, 
				report progress to date, present a range of relevant activities, and plan future collaboration. The attendees will be able to share their relevant 
				research, establish collaboration, get engaged in the SPLICE Community work, and obtain SPLICE  funding for collaborative research in the area.

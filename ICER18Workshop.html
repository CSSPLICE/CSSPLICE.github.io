<b>Workshop Theme:</b> Computing Science Educational Infrastructure: Crossing the Borders</b>
</p>

<b>Workshop Hosts:</b>
<ul>
  <li> Peter Brusilovsky, University of Pittsburgh</li>
  <li> Ken Koedinger, CMU</li>
  <li> Cliff Shaffer, Virginia Tech</li>
  <li> Steve Edwards, Virginia Tech</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Abstract:</b><br/>
The purpose of this workshop is to expand the borders of the SPLICE community, bringing together researchers from the United States, 
Europe, and the rest of the world who wish to contribute to the joint effort of designing and building an infrastructure for data-intensive research in Computing Education.

The infrastructure should support (1) broader re-use of innovative learning content that is instrumented for rich data collection, 
(2) formats and tools for analysis of learner data, and (3) development of best practices to make collections of learner data available to researchers. 
The workshop focus will be on how our tools can better interoperate, and how we can share both data and analysis tools to improve education research efforts across the discipline and beyond. 
We will introduce the goals of SPLICE Community, report progress to date, present a range of relevant activities, and plan future collaboration.

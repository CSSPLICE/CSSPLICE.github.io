      <h1>Datasets and Data Analytics</h1>

      <p>
        A primary mission for SPLICE is to support
        infrastructure to collect educational datasets, make them
        available to researchers, and provide appropriate analysis
        tools.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <a href="https://splice.cs.vt.edu/datasetcatalog/">
          SPLICE Dataset Catalog</a> provides a collection of datasets
        available from various sources. We welcome contributions of
        datasets!
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are our current dataset sources that are included in the
        dataset catalog:

            compilation of open-source datasets</a> in computing
          education, curated by the "Where is the data? Finding and
          reusing datasets in computing education" CompEd 23' working
          group. The working group aims to make research data more
          accessible and encourage open data practices in the computing
          education research (CER) community. For more information,
          please refer to the working group's paper: Kiesler, Natalie,

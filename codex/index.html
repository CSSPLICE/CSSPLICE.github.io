      <h1>SPLICE Working Group: Smart Learning Content Protocols</h1>

      <p><b>Leaders</b>: Peter Brusilovsky, Vasile Rus</p>

      <p><b>Rationale</b>
        Program code examples (known also as worked exampels) play a crucial role 
        in learning how to program. Instructors use examples extensively to 
        demonstrate the semantics of the programming language 
        being taught and to highlight the fundamental coding patterns. 
        Programming textbooks allocate considerable space to present and explain 
        code examples. To make the process of studying code examples more 
        interactive, CS education researchers developed a range of tools to engage 
        students in the study of code examples. These tools include codecasts 
        (codemotion,codecast,elicasts), interactive example explorers (WebEx, 
        PCEX), and tutoring systems (DeepTutor).

        An important component in all types of worked examples is code 
        explanations associated with specific code lines or code chunks of an 
        example. The explanations connect examples with general programming 
        knowledge explaining the role and function of code fragments or their 
        behavior.  In textbooks, these explanations are usually presented as 
        comments in the code or as explanations on the margins. The  
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Moc9DaofSNwFT6cqrq9wOZsPTPgO5sEhIRamv02hH0Y/edit#heading=h.b9tgjn7csrt6">
        example explorer tools</a> allow students to examine these explanations 
        interactively. Tutoring systems, which engage students in explaining 
        the code, use these model explanations to check student responses and 
        provide scaffolding.

        In all these cases, to make a worked example re-usable beyond its 
        presentation in a lecture, the explanations have to be authored by 
        instructors or domain experts i.e., produced and integrated into a specific 
        system. As the experience of the last 10 years demonstrated, these 
        explanations are hard to obtain. Those already collected are usually “locked”
        in a specific example-focused system and can’t be reused. The purpose of 
        this working group is to support broader re-used of worked examples 
        augmented with explanations. Our current plan is to develop а standard 
        approach to represent explained examples. This approach will enable an 
        example created for any of the existing systems to be explored in a standard 
        format and imported into any other example-focused system. We plan to 
        follow a successful experience of the
        <a href="https://cssplice.github.io/peml/">PEML working group</a> 
        focused on re-using programming exercises.</p>

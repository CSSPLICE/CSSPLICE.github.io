<h1>Administrative Support</h1>

This section provides a collection of resources related to
many non-technical issues that CS Education researchers
and systems builders have to deal with.

<h2>Data Access Policies</h2>

<p>Researchers are often in need of student-generated data.
  This might include data generated in the researchers' own courses,
  in other courses at their university, and in courses at other
  universities. This might include score data from course assignments,
  grades for the course, or tracking data of some sort related to
  student activity within educational software.</p>

<p>While some aspects of data acess and sharing are regulated by IRB
  protocols, in some instances universities have global policies
  regarding the regulation of access to such data.
  This section tries to provide some examples of related
  policy documents and data access forms.</p>

<h2>Hosting Information</h2>

<p>Help for tool developers who want to make their tools available
  outside their University, but who need options on how to host the
  software.</p>

<h2>Examples of IRB Protocols</h2>

  </ul>

<h2>HECVAT/VPAT Examples</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.educause.edu/hecvat">Higher Education Community Vendor Assessment Toolkit</a> is developed and maintained by Educause.
  It is intended to create a common, comprehensive tool for evaluating a variety of aspects important for instituations when evaluating third-party
  software tools. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ACX6fly0c3gPm_KA9bMZ2xJ8BKHrEFryuBD08NC_7BM/edit">Many universities</a> are now 
  requiring developers to provide a HECVAT form in order to be considered for adoption.</p>

<h2>Project Scale-up and Lifecycle Examples</h2>

<p>Examples of CS Educational software that has successfully scaled up.</p>

<h1>Administrative Support</h1>

This section provides a collection of resources related to
many non-technical issues that CS Education researchers
and systems builders have to deal with.

<h2>Data Access Policies</h2>

<p>Researchers are often in need of student-generated data.
  This might include data generated in the researchers' own courses,
  in other courses at their university, and in courses at other
  universities. This might include score data from course assignments,
  grades for the course, or tracking data of some sort related to
  student activity within educational software.</p>

<p>While some aspects of data acess and sharing are regulated by IRB
  protocols, in some instances universities have global policies
  regarding the regulation of access to such data.
  This section tries to provide some examples of related
  policy documents and data access forms.</p>

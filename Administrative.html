<h1>Administrative Support</h1>

<p>This section provides a collection of resources related to
many non-technical issues that CS Education researchers
and systems builders have to deal with.</p>

<h2>Data Access Policies</h2>

<p>Researchers are often in need of student-generated data.
  This might include data generated in the researchers' own courses,
  in other courses at their university, and in courses at other
  universities. This might include score data from course assignments,
  grades for the course, or tracking data of some sort related to
  student activity within educational software.</p>

<p>While some aspects of data acess and sharing are regulated by IRB
  protocols, in some instances universities have global policies
  regarding the regulation of access to such data.
  This section tries to provide some examples of related
  policy documents and data access forms.</p>

      and <a href="Administrative/UTorontoCommonReviewProcess.pdf">Informational
      slide deck</a> describing the University of Toronto data access review policy</a>

      <li><a href="https://redcap.utoronto.ca/surveys/?s=T9RXHEMWMJ">Data access request form</a></li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Hosting Information</h2>

<p>Help for tool developers who want to make their tools available
  outside their University, but who need options on how to host the
  software.</p>

<h2>Examples of IRB Protocols</h2>

<p>Readers should be aware that each university will typically have
its own form and process for IRB approval. While the examples here
should be helpful for writing similar documents, you will need to
get the exact forms necessary from the school that will grant the
  approval.</p>

<p>Also, be aware that IRB standards change over time, and can be
  different at different schools. Dates are shown for these documents.
  Permissions granted by a university as shown in older documents
  might possibly not be granted by that same institution today.</p>

<h2>HECVAT Examples</h2>

  <p>The <a href="https://www.educause.edu/hecvat">Higher Education Community Vendor Assessment Toolkit (HECVAT)</a> is developed and maintained by Educause.
  It is intended to create a common, comprehensive tool for evaluating a variety of aspects important for instituations when evaluating third-party
  software tools. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ACX6fly0c3gPm_KA9bMZ2xJ8BKHrEFryuBD08NC_7BM/edit">Many universities</a> are now 
  requiring developers to provide a HECVAT form in order to be considered for adoption.</p>
  
  <p>There are several flavors of the HECVAT. From the doc:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Triage: Used to initiate risk/security assessment requests - review to determine assessment requirements</li>
    <li>Full: Robust questionnaire used to assess the most critical data sharing engagements</li>
    <li>Lite: A lightweight questionnaire used to expedite process </li>
    <li>On-Premise: Unique questionnaire used to evaluate on-premise appliances and software</li>
  </ul>

  <p><a href="https://www.ren-isac.net/hecvat/cbi.html">Complete
      HECVATs for a number of commercial tools are able</a>.
    If you have completed a HECVAT for your software tool, please
    consider contributing it to SPLICE as an example for others.</p>

  </ul>
  
  
<h2>VPAT/ACR Examples</h2>
  
  <p>The <a href="https://www.itic.org/policy/accessibility/vpat">Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPATÂ®)</a> is a standard document 
    developed by the Information Technology Industry Council for software developers to create an Accessibility Conformance Report (ACR) to 
    explain how their tools meet national and international standards for accessibility. Many state and national governments 
    require a completed Accessibility Conformance Report as part of the evaluation for adopting third-party tools. 

  <p>Many vendors make the their VPAT/ACR publically available (for example: 
    <a href="https://www.instructure.com/products/canvas/accessibility">Canvas</a> |
    <a href="https://docs.moodle.org/401/en/VPAT">Moodle</a> |

    <a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.google.com/en//accessibility/static/pdf/google-chrome-windows-vpat.pdf">Chrome for Windows</a>).
    If you have completed a VPAT for your software tool, please consider contributing it as an example for others.</p>

<h2>Project Scale-up and Lifecycle Examples</h2>

<p>This section contains a "system stories".
  Most CS educational software never gets beyond the proof-of-concept
  phase.
  Sometimes CS educational software gets prototyped and deployed for a
  couple years in the developer's own classes.
  A small number of software projects get "institutionalized" for
  long-term adoption locally, and/or distributed and used more
  widely, and for a long time.</p>
  
<p>Getting a project adopted widely, and put on a long-term sustainable
  basis is difficult.
  This section is meant to give presentations about CS Educational
  software that has (more or less) successfully scaled up.
  The goal of presenting "system stories" is to give developers in earlier
  stages of the software system lifecycle some ideas of how other
  groups have successfully or unsuccessfully navigated scaleing up and
  reaching long-term stabilty.

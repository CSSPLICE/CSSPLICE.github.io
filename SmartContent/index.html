      <h1>SPLICE: Smart Learning Content</h1>

      <p>A team of CS Education researchers gathered together as a
        Working Group at ACM SIGCSE 2014 and introduced the term
        “Smart Learning Content” (SLC) to describe a diverse set of
        interactive learning resources that were becoming increasingly
        more popular in CS Education [1].
        A key goal of the SPLICE project to promote broader
        development and reuse of SLC in CS educational research and
        practice.
        Over the years, the SPLICE team has been studying best
        practices in SLC and collecting various types of SLC for its
        live catalog of SLC [2].

      <p>
        This work encouraged us to develop a taxonomy of smart
        learning content feature types.
        This taxonomy attempts to classify SLC by its type (worked
        examples  vs problems), and the knowledge that it helps to develop
        (code tracing vs program construction).

        The SPLICE project also develops protocols to support
        specifying SLC content, and for implementations to
        interconnect.

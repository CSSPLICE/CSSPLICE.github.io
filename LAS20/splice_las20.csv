As a result, the process of selecting TAs is important, yet we often have little information when making hiring decisions. We used data collected from a course discussion board to identify which statistics are indicative of participation and which might be useful for hiring TAs. We then analyzed our past TA hires and found that there are opportunities to use discussion board metrics to increase the number of potentially qualified applicants for TA roles and better inform instructors about the engagement of past students as they select candidates for interviews.",
12,Peer Reviewed Paper,"Mohsen Dorodchi, Mohammadali Fallahian, Erfan Al-Hossami, Aileen Benedict and Alexandria Benedict","Custom ""Caring IDE"" for Online Offering of CS1","The role of an integrated IDE capable of several different key features in teaching and learning programming is very clear to everyone.
In this work-in-progress paper, we present the new version of our \textit{Caring IDE}, a cloud-based IDE system integrated with a Learning Management System (LMS), an autograder, databases for storage, and dashboard prototypes to (1) deliver a smoother programming learning experience for students and (2) enhance the instructor's ability to informatively perform student success interventions quickly and early. Here, we report and extrapolate on the design and implementation of the \textit{Caring IDE}. We also demonstrate the value of the \textit{Caring IDE} in promoting student-self learning in an online CS1 summer course during the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, we showcase preliminary IDE-based analytics to promote student success in CS courses.",

3,Peer Reviewed Lightning Talk,"Lucas Roy, Haotian Yang and Lisa Zhang",CS1 Programming Feedback with Bug Localization,This paper presents the work in progress towards generating automatic feedback to student solutions to CS1 coding questions that highlights regions of the code that may be problematic. We use a Recurrent Neural Network to generate such feedback. We use a data-driven approach to train the model by re-purposing past student submissions and student corrections to their own code. We present preliminary results of a model that works on one problem. We hope to eventually integrate this kind of feedback in a CS1 setting.,
4,Peer Reviewed Lightning Talk,Adam Gaweda and Collin Lynch,TYPOS: A Computer Science Exercise Platform,"Computer Science has a number of exercise types available for learning. However, it is unknown when the appropriate exercise type should be given to students on their path to learning CS. This paper describes TYPOS, a Computer Science Exercise Platform that hosts a variety of exercise types. These CS exercises range in complexity and interactivity based on the ICAP framework. As part of this paper, we provide a brief overview over each exercise type and their respective complexity. Finally, we present considerations for future research on using TYPOS for activity sequence mining and suggested next practice activities for students.",
5,Peer Reviewed Lightning Talk,"Philip Guo, Julia Markel and Xiong Zhang",Learnersourcing at Scale for Introductory Programming: Longitudinal Data Collection on the Python Tutor Website,"The Python Tutor website (pythontutor.com) currently gets over 10,000 daily active users executing around 100,000 pieces of code daily. We have been experimenting with collecting large-scale data about learners' thought processes while coding. For instance, we created a learnersourcing system that elicits explanations of potential misconceptions from learners as they fix errors. We have deployed this system for the past three years to the Python Tutor website and collected 16,791 learner-written explanations. By inspecting this dataset, we found surprising insights that we did not originally think of due to our own expert blind spots as programming instructors. We are now using these insights to improve compiler and run-time error messages to explain common novice misconceptions.",
6,Peer Reviewed Lightning Talk,Ryan Hardt and Kamil Akhuseyinoglu,Database Query Analyzer Integration,"This paper describes updates to Database Query Analyzer (DBQA) that increase its interoperability with other learning tools using the Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) protocol. As a result, DBQA has been integrated with Mastery Grids and allows for integration with learning management systems.",
7,Peer Reviewed Lightning Talk,"Alexander Hicks, Kamil Akhuseyinoglu, Clifford Shaffer and Peter Brusilovsky",Live Catalog of Smart Learning Objects for Computer Science Education,"We present the initial version of a ""live catalog"" of LTI enabled smart learning objects that instructors and educators are able to preview and test before deciding whether to integrate these tools in their own courses. The catalog is available on the public Instructure Canvas site and currently showcases LTI tools from multiple educational institutions.",
8,Peer Reviewed Lightning Talk,Zak Risha and Peter Brusilovsky,Making it Smart: Converting Static Code into an Interactive Trace Table,"This paper introduces a new type of smart learning content, an automatically generated trace table, that can easily integrate and adapt to existing curriculum and learning systems for computer science education. In addition to current features of the software, we describe how this tool constructs trace tables using only source code as an input. The potential of this tool is also explored by examining future opportunities in adaptation, feedback, and learning specifications. Last, we report a pilot integration into an existing system to demonstrate interoperability with a tangible use case.",
11,Peer Reviewed Lightning Talk,Barbara Ericson and Bradley Miller,Runestone: An Open-Source Platform for Interactive Ebooks,"The Runestone platform is an open-source platform for interactive ebooks. It served over 100,000 registered learners and an average of 800 thousand page views per week during the 2019 - 2020 academic year. There are ebooks for secondary computer science as well as for undergraduate computing courses: CS1, CS2, data science, and web programming. There is even an ebook for a course on Linear Algebra. The platform supports executable and editable examples in Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, JavaScript, Processing, and SQL. It also includes code visualizers/steppers for Python, Java, and C++ code. The ebooks contain typical instructional material: text, videos, and images. They also include practice problems with immediate feedback such as multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, and matching questions. Runestone also has unusual features such as audio tours of code, clickable areas, adaptive Parsons problems, and a unique practice tool. This paper highlights some of the unusual features, explains the log data that is collected and is available for analysis, and describes plans for future development.",

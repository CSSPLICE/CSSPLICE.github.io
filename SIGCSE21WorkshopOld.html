        CS Education Infrastructure for All III: From Ideas to Practice
      </h1>

      <p>
        The seventh SPLICE Project workshop will be held in
        conjunction with SIGCSE 2021, online, on Monday, March 15 and
        Tuesday, March 16, 2021. The sessions will run from
        10:00am-12:30pm each day.
        Please <a href="mailto:cssplice@gmail.com">contact us</a> if
        you have questions.

        <b>Workshop Theme:</b> CS Education Infrastructure for All
        III: From Ideas to Practice
      </p>
      <p>

      <b>Workshop Hosts:</b>

        <li> Cliff Shaffer, Virginia Tech</li>
        <li> Peter Brusilovsky, University of Pittsburgh</li>

      <p><b>Abstract:</b><br/>
        Increasingly, the meat of many CS courses is provided by many
        interactive, auto-assessed exercises, referred to as "smart
        content". These tools engage students, provide valuable
        feedback, and allow collection of data for further
        analysis. While it remains a challenge to connect these tools
        to learning management systems (LMS), eTextbooks and IDEs,
        standards like Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) make it
        possible. Interoperability is improving year by
        year. Collecting, distributing, and analyzing the rapidly
        growing collections of data generated by click streams coming
        from such tools is still a major challenge. But progress is
        being made both in improved analysis tools and in standards
        for collecting data, like student attempts at solving
        programming problems This NSF-supported workshop is the third
        in a series of SIGCSE pre-symposium events in support of the
        SPLICE project. The goal of SPLICE is to support and better
        coordinate efforts to build community and capacity among
        Computer Science Education (CSEd) researchers, data
        scientists, and learning scientists toward reducing
        barriers. CSEd infrastructure should support (1) broader
        re-use of innovative learning content instrumented for rich
        data collection, (2) formats and tools for analysis of learner
        data, and (3) development of best practices to make
        collections of learner data available to researchers. The
        organizers and presenters will share progress from ongoing
        projects and collaborations, attempting to build an agenda for
        the community to strive for in the coming years.

          <li>SIGCSE Conference: March 15-20, 2021
        </ul>

        
      <p><b>Intended Audience:</b><br/>
        The audience is expected to consist of CSEd tool builders,
        developers of student analytics data analysis tools, and CSEd
        researchers who would like to make use of user interaction
        data collected by their own projects or by others. We are
        expecting about 50 attendees.
      </p>

      <p><b>Organization:</b><br/>
        The workshop is organized by the SPLICE (Standards, Protocols,
        and Learning Infrastructure for Computing Education) project team,
        in association with the NSF-supported project
        Community-Building and Infrastructure Design for
        Data-Intensive Research in Computer Science Education. It
        follows a sequence of the previous SPLICE and CSEDM workshops
        organized at SIGCSE, EDM, AIED, ICER, LAK, and ACM L@S
        conferences. More information about SPLICE and past workshops
        can be found at  http://cssplice.org.
      </p>

      <p><b>Call for Papers and Lightning Presentations:</b><br/>
        We are inviting prospective participants to submit 4-6-page
        short papers and 2-page “lightning” papers about their past
        and ongoing work related to CS Education Infrastructure. We
        are especially interested in papers focused on collaborations,
        integrations, and re-use in the spirit of the SPLICE
        project. So if you have a working collaboration where you are
        reusing and bringing together various software tools and/or
        smart content, or are sharing data sets or learner analytics
        data analysis tools, then we would like to hear about it. Most
        valuable in the context of the workshop would be papers
        focusing on the following topics, although all work related to
        the SPLICE goals will be considered.
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Descriptions of "smart" learning tools or programming
          environments, which interact with students and collect
          interaction/performance data</li>
        <li>Design and experience of infrastructures that could
          integrate multiple "smart" learning tools</li>
        <li>Case studies of collaboration where reproducible practices were
          used to integrate two or more data-producing learning tools from
          different institutions</li>
        <li>Approaches and infrastructures that could collect and
          integrate data from multiple learning tools (e.g. forum
          posts, LMS activity, and programming data)</li>
        <li>Descriptions of shareable Computer Science education
          datasets</li>
        <li>Descriptions of data mining/analytics approaches applied to
          specifically Computer Science datasets</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The authors of accepted papers will be able to present their work
        in the workshop as Short talks of 15 minutes and Lightning Talks of
        7 minutes. The papers will be published online as a part of the
        Workshop Proceedings and will be publicized on the SPLICE project
        site.</p>
      
      <p>If you have a contribution accepted to the mainstream SIGCSE
        conference that matches any topic of the workshop, we encourage you
        to submit a 2-page lightning paper for the workshop
        consideration. It will help to publicize and discuss your work
        within a broader community.</p>

      <p>Please submit papers
      to <a href="https://easychair.org/my/login_author?conference=258195">our

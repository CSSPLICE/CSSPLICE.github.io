  abstract = {Practical programming is one of the basic skills pursued in computer science education. On programming courses, the coursework consists of programming assignments that need to be assessed from different points of view. Since the submitted assignments are executable programs with a formal structure, some features can be assessed automatically. The basic requirement for automated assessment is the numerical measurability of assessment targets, but semiautomatic approaches can overcome this restriction. Recognizing automatically assessable features can help teachers to create educational models, where automatic tools let teachers concentrate their work on the learning issues that need student-teacher interaction the most. Several automatic tools for both static and dynamic assessment of computer programs have been reported in the literature. This article promotes these issues by surveying several automatic approaches for assessing programming assignments. Not all the existing tools will be covered, simply because of the vast number of them. The article concentrates on bringing forward different assessment techniques and approaches to give an interested reader starting points for finding further information in the area. Automatic assessment tools can be used to help teachers in grading tasks as well as to support students' working process with automatic feedback. Common advantages of automation are the speed, availability, consistency and objectivity of assessment. However, automatic tools emphasize the need for careful pedagogical design of the assignment and assessment settings. To effectively share the knowledge and good assessment solutions already developed, better interoperability and portability of the tools is needed.},

  abstract = {To successfully bring introductory computing to non-CS majors, one needs to create a curriculum that will appeal to students from diverse disciplines. Several educational theories emphasize the need for introductory contexts that align with students' long-term goals and are perceived as useful. Data Science, using algorithms to manipulate real-world data and interpreting the results, has emerged as a field with cross-disciplinary value, and has strong potential as an appealing context for introductory computing courses. However, it is not easy to find, clean, and integrate datasets that will satisfy a broad variety of learners. The CORGIS project (https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis) enables instructors to easily incorporate data science into their classroom. Specifically, it provides over 40 datasets in areas including history, politics, medicine, and education. Additionally, the CORGIS infrastructure supports the integration of new datasets with simple libraries for Java, Python, and Racket, thus empowering introductory students to write programs that manipulate real data. Finally, the CORGIS web-based tools allow learners to visualize and explore datasets without programming, enabling data science lessons on day one. We have incorporated CORGIS assignments into an introductory course for non-majors to study their impact on learners' motivation, with positive initial results. These results indicate that external adopters are likely to find the CORGIS tools and materials useful in their own pedagogical pursuits.},

In our analysis we focused on examining the technical issues that must be resolved to support finding, integrating and customizing smart learning content in computer science courses. Finally, we propose a new architecture for hosting, integrating and disseminating smart learning content and discuss how it could be implemented based on existing protocols and standards.},

Here, the instructors are asked to provide a set of code examples that jointly reflect the learning goals that are associated with each course unit. The Wizard is built on top of our course-authoring tool, and it helps to decrease the time instructors spend on the task and to maintain the coherence of the sequential structure of the course. It also provides instructors with additional information to identify content that might be not appropriate for the unit they are creating. We conducted an off-line study with data collected from an introductory Java course previously taught at the University of Pittsburgh in order to evaluate both the practicality and effectiveness of the system. We found that the proposed recommendation's performance is relatively close to the teacher's expectation in creating a computer-based adaptive course.},

This activity can be extremely useful from a program understanding perspective as well as a debugging perspective. In contrast, testing (e.g., with JUnit) provides a way to create persistent test cases and then run and re-run them in an efficient way. We have observed that dynamic program viewing and testing are quite complementary. When test cases are written and executed, dynamic program viewing becomes a valuable aid in traditional debugging as well. Since most test cases are written at the functional level (e.g., did a method return the expected value?), dynamically viewing test methods as they execute can provide students with a deeper level of understanding. The jGRASP IDE has been extended to allow students to combine dynamic program viewing with JUnit testing. In this paper, we discuss both the technical success of this effort and several examples that demonstrate the potential for student use in early computing courses.},

Intelligent tutoring has been deployed for well-defined and relatively static educational domains such as algebra and geometry. However, this adaptive approach to computer-based training has yet to come into wider usage for domains that are less well defined or where student-system interactions are less structured, such as during scenario-based simulation and immersive serious games. In order to address how to expand the reach of adaptive training technology to these domains, leading experts in the field present their work in areas such as student modeling, pedagogical strategy, knowledge assessment, natural language processing, and virtual human agents. Several approaches to designing adaptive technology are discussed for both traditional educational settings and professional training domains. This book will appeal to anyone concerned with educational and training technology at a professional level, including researchers, training systems developers, and designers.},

However, AVs have traditionally focused on illustrating the mechanics of how an algorithm works. We have developed visualizations that we name Algorithm Analysis Visualizations (AAVs), that focus on conveying algorithm analysis concepts. We present our findings from an initial evaluation study of the effectiveness of AAVs when applied to a semester long Data Structures course. AAVs were evaluated in terms of student engagement, student satisfaction, and student performance. Results indicate that the intervention group students spent significantly more time with the AAVs than did the control group students who used primarily textual content. Students gave positive feedback regarding the usefulness of the AAVs in illustrating algorithm analysis concepts. Students from the intervention group had better performance on the algorithm analysis part of the final exam than did control group students.},

In particular we were interested in seeing if the students will attempt to manipulate the electronic resources so as to receive credit without deeply going through the materials. We found that a majority of students do not read the text. On the other hand, we found evidence that students voluntarily complete additional exercises (after obtaining credit for completion) as a study aid prior to exams. We determined that visualization use was fairly high (even when credit for their completion was not offered). Skipping to the end of slideshows was more common when credit for their completion was offered, but also occurred when it was not. We measured the level of use of mobile devices for learning by CS students. Almost all students did not associate their mobile devices with studying. The only time they accessed OpenDSA from a mobile device was for a quick look up, and never for in depth study.},

The former displays an explanation for a subset of lines in plain text, whereas the latter visualizes code execution. We studied the use and impact of these enhanced examples, provided as non-mandatory practice content, in three introductory Java courses. Our results suggest that animated examples are more engaging and have a positive impact on students' learning. As compared to annotated examples, students spent more time with animated examples and more likely completed them. Also, a positive relationship was found between the number of explored animated examples and the overall course grade.},

In literature, we can find many references to weaker students, fast learners, struggling students, etc. Given the lack of detailed data about students, these or other kinds of stereotypes could be potentially used for user modeling and personalization in the educational context. Recent research in MOOC context demonstrated that data-driven learner stereotypes could work well for detecting and preventing student dropouts. In this paper, we are exploring the application of stereotype-based modeling to a more challenging task -- predicting student problem-solving and learning in two programming courses and two MOOCs. We explore traditional stereotypes based on readily available factors like gender or education level as well as some advanced data-driven approaches to group students based on their problem-solving behavior. Each of the approaches to form student stereotype cohorts is validated by comparing models of student learning: do students in different groups learn differently? In the search for the stereotypes that could be used for adaptation, the paper examines ten approaches. We compare the performance of these approaches and draw conclusions for future research.},

We performed a classroom study to examine the impact of this combined guidance approach.

We introduce the Control-Flow Abstract Syntax Tree (CFAST), a representation of source code that focuses on control structures, and apply it in an analysis of a large, multinational dataset of introductory programming exercises. We provide data on how many different control-flow designs are observed, how quickly students identify a "correct" control flow structure, and how much additional work is required to convert a correct structure to a correct program. Our results indicate that while even simple problems yield a surprising number of CFASTs, the work of most students can be mapped to a small number of CFASTs. CFASTs that map to fewer submissions tend to be larger, and more complex, but they can still correspond to "correct" solutions to the problem.},

This knowledge can be used to inform decisions related to course and tool design and pedagogy, and to further engage students and guide those at risk of failure. This working group report provides an overview of the body of knowledge regarding the use of educational data mining and learning analytics focused on the teaching and learning of programming. In a literature survey on mining students' programming processes for 2005-2015, we observe a significant increase in work related to the field. However, the majority of the studies focus on simplistic metric analysis and are conducted within a single institution and a single course. This indicates the existence of further avenues of research and a critical need for validation and replication to better understand the various contributing factors and the reasons why certain results occur. We introduce a novel taxonomy to analyse replicating studies and discuss the importance of replicating and reproducing previous work. We describe what is the state of the art in collecting and sharing programming data. To better understand the challenges involved in replicating or reproducing existing studies, we report our experiences from three case studies using programming data. Finally, we present a discussion of future directions for the education and research community.},

They do not adequately cater for different approaches to constructing a program. After studying solutions to automatically assessed programming exercises, we found out that many different solutions are composed of a relatively small set of mutually similar code lines. Thus, they can be constructed by using the drag-and-drop approach if only it was possible to edit some small parts of the predefined fragments. Based on this, we have designed and implemented a new exercise type for mobile devices that builds on Parsons problems and falls somewhere between their strict scaffolding and full-blown coding exercises. In these exercises, we can gradually fade the scaffolding and allow programs to be constructed more freely so as not to restrict thinking and limit creativity too much while still making sure we are able to deploy them to small-screen mobile devices. In addition to the new concept and the related implementation, we discuss other possibilities of how programming could be practiced on mobile devices.},

We have also identified a list of novel features, like assessing web software, that are likely to get more research attention in the future. As a conclusion, we state that too many new systems are developed, but also acknowledge the current reasons for the phenomenon.

We describe how automated assessment is incorporated into BOSS such that it supports, rather than constrains, assessment. The pedagogic and administrative issues that are affected by the assessment process are also discussed.},

However, most of them have remained as research prototypes and almost none have gained wide acceptance by teachers as classroom demonstration tools. One of the key reasons for this has been that preparing animations has been too laborious. In this paper, we demonstrate a new tool, MatrixPro, in which animations are generated in terms of visual algorithm simulation. The user can graphically invoke ready-made operations available in the library to simulate the working of real algorithms. Since the system understands the semantics of the operations, the teacher can ex tempore demonstrate the execution of algorithms with different input sets, or work with "what-if" questions students ask in lectures. Such an approach lowers considerably the step for adopting algorithm visualization as a regular lecture tool.},

In the model, the first stage of the pre-test-practice post-test evaluation protocol is used to initialize the student model needed for adaptation. In order to keep assessment congruent with learning, the same type of activity is used in all three stages of evaluation, and the software tutor itself is used to administer all three stages of the protocol. In order to minimize time while maximizing learning, post-test is set to adapt to practice, and students are also provided feedback after pre-test activities on which they provide incorrect response. Finally, the software tutor is set up to administer the pre-test-practice-post-test protocol as one seamless integrated session with no discernible breaks between the stages. This model of deployment helps the developer evaluate the effectiveness of the software tutor, helps the student minimize time while maximizing learning and enables the instructor to obtain concept-level summary of what worked and what needs to be reviewed again in the classroom. The deployment model has been implemented in software tutors for programming, called problets (problets.org). We produce quantitative data from three problets used in spring 2013 to illustrate the benefits of the deployment model that accrue to developers, students and instructors.},

The course is a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC), as the attendance scales without an upper bound. Schools in Finland have offered the MOOC as an elective CS course for their students and granted formal school credits for completing (parts of) it. Since our MOOC is exactly the same programming course as our university-level CS1 course, we are able to use the MOOC also as a long-lasting entrance exam to the CS BSc and MSc degrees. After two spring semesters of operation, we have observed that there are school students dispersed around Finland who are ready and willing to take on a challenging programming course online, and bridging the MOOC to a full study right makes a strong incentive to keep working on the programming assignments, even without traditional teaching.},

However, very fine-grained data such as source code snapshots can contain hidden identifiers. For example, distinct typing patterns that identify individuals can be extracted from such data. Hence, simply removing explicit identifiers such as names and student numbers is not sufficient to protect the privacy of the users who have supplied the data. At the same time, removing all keystroke information would decrease the value of the shared data significantly. In this work, we study how keystroke data from a programming context could be modified to prevent keystroke latency based identification whilst still retaining information that can be used to e.g. infer programming experience. We investigate the degree of anonymization required to render identification of students based on their typing patterns unreliable. Then, we study whether the modified keystroke data can still be used to infer the programming experience of the students as a case study of whether the anonymized typing patterns have retained at least some informative value. We show that it is possible to modify data so that keystroke latency based identification is no longer accurate, but the programming experience of the students can still be inferred, i.e. the data still has value to researchers. In a broader context, our results indicate that information and anonymity are not necessarily mutually exclusive.},

Since 2008, MOOCs have been run by a variety of public and elite universities, especially in North America. Many academics have taken interest in MOOCs recognising the potential to deliver education around the globe on an unprecedented scale; some of these academics are taking a research-oriented perspective and academic papers describing their research are starting to appear in the traditional media of peer reviewed publications. This paper presents a systematic review of the published MOOC literature (2008-2012): Forty-five peer reviewed papers are identified through journals, database searches, searching the Web, and chaining from known sources to form the base for this review. We believe this is the first effort to systematically review literature relating to MOOCs, a fairly recent but massively popular phenomenon with a global reach. The review categorises the literature into eight different areas of interest, introductory, concept, case studies, educational theory, technology, participant focussed, provider focussed, and other, while also providing quantitative analysis of publications according to publication type, year of publication, and contributors. Future research directions guided by gaps in the literature are explored.},

This model contrasts with traditional course offerings, which impose a single schedule of due dates and exams for all students. SPARC allows students to complete courses faster or slower at a pace tailored to the individual, thereby allowing universities to teach more students with the same or fewer resources.

The book examines three foundations of ITSs in detail -- expert, student diagnostic, and instructional or curricular knowledge -- and describes:   * How they are embodied in computer-assisted instructional environments  * How these systems accrue the advantages of advanced computer interface technologies  * How ITSs will emerge in the real world of complex problem solving  * How researchers must learn to evaluate the effectiveness and overall quality of these dynamic systems in a world where machine tutoring may one day be taken for granted. Justine Wise Polier (1903-1987) was educated at Bryn Mawr, Radcliffe, and Barnard. She earned her law degree from Yale Law School where she was editor of the Yale Law Journal.   In 1935, she was appointed Justice of the Family Court where she sat for 38 years. Judge Polier took a leave from the bench in 1941 when she was appointed special advisor to Eleanor Roosevelt at the Office of Civilian Defense in Washington. She also served as Chairman of the Committee on Mental Health for New York.   Judge Polier was a founder and president of the Wiltwyck School; vice president of the Citizens Committee for Children of N.Y.; vice president of the American Jewish Congress; Delegate to the White House Conferences on Children and on Education. Judge Polier was a member of the Institute of Judicial Administration, American Bar Association. She was on the editorial board of the International Juridical Association and was awarded the 1964 Isaac Ray Award by the American Psychiatric Association for "contributions to the improvement of the relations of Law and Psychiatry." Following her retirement from the bench, she served as the director of the Juvenile Judge division of the Children's Defense Fund.  During her illustrious career, Judge Polier was the recipient of numerous awards including: the Citation for Distinguished Service to the City of New York, 1973; the Human Services Award from the New York and Bronx Mental Health Association, 1973; the Eleanor Roosevelt Humanitarian Award from the Board of Directors of Wiltwyck School, 1975.   Judge Polier also published numerous reports and several books including: Everyone's Children, Nobody's Child; Back to What Woodshed?; A View from the Bench; and The Rule of Law and the Role of Psychiatry.},

  abstract = {In the early 1980s researchers began building systems to visualize computer programs and algorithms using newly emerging graphical workstation technology. After more than a decade of advances in interface technology, a large variety of systems has been built and many different aspects of the visualization process have been investigated. As in any new branch of a science, a taxonomy is required so that researchers can use a common language to discuss the merits of existing systems, classify new ones (to see if they really are new) and identify gaps which suggest promising areas for further development. Several authors have suggested taxonomies for these visualization systems, but they have been ad hoc and have relied on only a handful of characteristics to describe a large and diverse area of work. Another major drawback of these taxonomies is their inability to accommodate expansion: there is no clear way to add new categories when the need arises. In this paper we present a detailed taxonomy of systems for the visualization of computer software. This taxonomy was derived from an established black-box model of software and is composed of a hierarchy with six broad categories at the top and over 30 leaf-level nodes at four hierarchical levels. We describe 12 important systems in detail and apply the taxonomy to them in order to illustrate its features. After discussing each system in this context, we analyse its coverage of the categories and present a research agenda for future work in the area.},

However, the rate of AV use and overall impact on education does not match the positive interest in their use that instructors report. Surveys of CS faculty show that impediments to successful use of AVs in the classroom include difficulties in finding quality AVs on desired topics, difficulties in adapting AVs to a given classroom setting, and lack of knowledge on the best way to deploy AVs. This indicates a need for better support for instructors, to get them past these barriers. We seek to provide this support through an online educational community that relies on a new model based less on the "digital library" approach of information gained by going to a site and searching. Instead, the focus is on community-added content through members' discussions, reviews, and ratings of content items. The AlgoViz community effort will better focus the future direction of AV development and use.},

Using this information, the system automatically derives minimal corrections to student's incorrect solutions, providing them with a measure of exactly how incorrect a given solution was, as well as feedback about what they did wrong. We introduce a simple language for describing error models in terms of correction rules, and formally define a rule-directed translation strategy that reduces the problem of finding minimal corrections in an incorrect program to the problem of synthesizing a correct program from a sketch. We have evaluated our system on thousands of real student attempts obtained from the Introduction to Programming course at MIT (6.00) and MITx (6.00x). Our results show that relatively simple error models can correct on average 64\% of all incorrect submissions in our benchmark set.},

Our focus is on generic systems that are capable of illustrating many kinds of programs and behaviors. We inclusively describe such systems from the last three decades and review findings from their empirical evaluations. A comparable review on the topic does not previously exist; ours is intended to serve as a reference for the creators, evaluators, and users of educational program visualization systems. Moreover, we revisit the issue of learner engagement which has been identified as a potentially key factor in the success of educational software visualization and summarize what little is known about engagement in the context of the generic program visualization systems for beginners that we have reviewed; a proposed refinement of the frameworks previously used by computing education researchers to rank types of learner engagement is a side product of this effort. Overall, our review illustrates that program visualization systems for beginners are often short-lived research prototypes that support the user-controlled viewing of program animations; a recent trend is to support more engaging modes of user interaction. The results of evaluations largely support the use of program visualization in introductory programming education, but research to date is insufficient for drawing more nuanced conclusions with respect to learner engagement. On the basis of our review, we identify interesting questions to answer for future research in relation to themes such as engagement, the authenticity of learning tasks, cognitive load, and the integration of program visualization into introductory programming pedagogy.},

In order, they emphasize topdown program design, incremental learning, and program modification and amplification. In contrast, tactics are specific design plans that prescribe methods to reach desired learning outcomes under given circumstances. Based on ACT* (Anderson, 1983) and relevant research, we distinguish between declarative and procedural instruction and present six tactics which can be used both to design courses and to evaluate strategies. Three tactics for declarative instruction involve concrete computer models, programming plans and design diagrams; three tactics for procedural instruction involve worked-out examples, practice of basic cognitive skills and task variation. In our evaluation of groups of instructional strategies, the Reading approach has been found to be superior to the Expert and Spiral approaches.},

In observing mode students are simply browsing the online platform, watching videos, reading material, reading book or watching forums. In submitting mode, students submit information to the platform. This includes submissions towards quizzes, homeworks, or any assessment modules. In collaborating mode students interact with other students or instructors on forums, collaboratively editing wiki or chatting on google hangout or other hangout venues. With this basic definitions of activities, and a data model to store events pertaining to these activities, we then create a common terminology to map Coursera and edX data into this shared data model.

  abstract = {Programming is a subject that many beginning students find difficult. The PHP Intelligent Tutoring System (PHP ITS) has been designed with the aim of making it easier for novices to learn the PHP language in order to develop dynamic web pages. Programming requires practice. This makes it necessary to include practical exercises in any ITS that supports students learning to program. The PHP ITS works by providing exercises for students to solve and then providing feedback based on their solutions. The major challenge here is to be able to identify many semantically equivalent solutions to a single exercise. The PHP ITS achieves this by using theories of Artificial Intelligence (AI) including first-order predicate logic and classical and hierarchical planning to model the subject matter taught by the system. This paper highlights the approach taken by the PHP ITS to analyse students' programs that include a number of program constructs that are used by beginners of web development. The PHP ITS was built using this model and evaluated in a unit at the Queensland University of Technology. The results showed that it was capable of correctly analysing over 96~\% of the solutions to exercises supplied by students.},

The tool provides a web-based form that allows an instructor to enter a program and designate parts of the program as code blocks that are to be completed by the student. For each code block the instructor provides a set of instructions, solution code, and a scoring rubric. The instructor also provides a set of test cases for the entire program. Students complete the problem by writing a block at a time and testing their code using their own test cases. Any empty blocks are compiled using the instructor-provided code. Students may submit code blocks at any time for automatic grading by CodeAssessor. If the student's code does not compile, or the student's output does not match the instructor's output, the student is given appropriate feedback and is allowed to try again. The student is shown the instructor's code either upon correct completion of the code block, when the points available for the code block become 0, or the student gives up. This tool can be used for homework assignments, for exam problems, or for in-class assignments. Although the current language is C++, a one-line change to a couple PhP scripts is all that is required to change the compiler and execution environment to another language, such as Java. By providing the student with portions of the program, and by displaying the instructor's model solution code, we hope to help students move through a problem more expeditiously and with greater understanding.},

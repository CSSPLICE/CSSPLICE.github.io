      <h1>William Billingsley<br/>
        A Technologist's Agenda for Scriptable, Smart, Social, and Republishable Courses
      </h1>
      <p>
        This position paper describes the personal agenda of a
        lesser-known technologist and academic, who has been working
        on smart and social education technology since the early 2000s.</p>

      <p>
        Since 2015, I have also been the coordinator for a
        bachelor-level computer science degree at a regional
        Australian university with a small on-campus cohort and larger
        online cohort. Market pressures encourage us to pursue greater
        flexibility in modes and times of study, greater authenticity
        in how study relates to industrial practice, and greater
        connectivity in how our systems and studies interact with
        those of the wider community. As a technologist, this also
        motivates me to draw from four previous projects, to try to
        create technologies and techniques to make this ever-greater
        flexibility viable for a small computer science teaching
        team.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        By combining techniques from these projects, I aim to produce
        a small open source set of utilities to support publishing of
        smart, social, courses that support authentic tasks and can
        run and be managed in a variety of formats.

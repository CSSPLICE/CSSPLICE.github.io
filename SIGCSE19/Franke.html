        Research Partnerships @ Code.org
      </h1>

      <p>
        Abstract: In this talk Iâ€™ll describe Code.org's burgeoning
        Research Partnership program with the goal of spurring the
        interest of one or two members of this audience to partner
        with us on a research project.  Ultimately Code.org is not a
        research house, but we do capture data representing a decent
        percentage of the K-12 CS education audience in the US, and
        much of that data goes unexplored. I'll describe why Code.org
        is interested in research partnerships, the kinds of data we
        have, our lightweight research infrastructure, and a few
        examples of active partnerships that might be germane to this
        audience.

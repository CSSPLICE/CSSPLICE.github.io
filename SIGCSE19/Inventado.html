        Exploring the use of unit tests, linters, and format checkers to enhance computer-programming instruction
      </h1>

      <p>
        It takes a lot of practice to master a complex skill like
        programming. CS instructors provide as much programming exercises as
        they can to students, but struggle with the time and effort required
        for creating problems, checking, and providing feedback on studentsâ€™
        solutions. Many instructors have used unit tests, which are programs
        that compare the output of student programs against expected
        results, to check for code correctness then manually check coding
        style and design. We are currently building a framework to explore
        the use of linters and format checkers in addition to unit tests to
        check the design and style of code written in C++. These tools catch
        common issues that significantly speeds up checking. We used the
        framework to create a programming-problem repository that
        instructors can use to assign exercises in class. Informal
        interviews with instructors indicated that the addition of linters
        and format checkers helped encourage their students to use coding
        best practices. We have also begun to store log data from the
        automated checkers. We plan to use these data for analyzing student
        progress in solving programming problems and gathering insights that
        can help inform instructor feedback.

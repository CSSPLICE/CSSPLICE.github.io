        Integrating OpenDSA and CodeWorkout with the Canvas LMS
      </h1>

      <p>
        There exist numerous "smart learning tools", each serving
        different purposes. A primary challenge associated with these
        tools is getting them to work together smoothly and with
        minimal overhead for the end-user (e.g., instructors or
        students). We describe the infrastructure behind the
        integration of two learning tools with the Canvas LMS. This
        infrastructure is LTI compliant and is in use at several US
        universities.
      </p>

      <p>
        OpenDSA is an e-textbook project that allows instructors to
        create custom books by putting together combinations of
        available modules, and CodeWorkout is an online system that
        serves short programming exercises and multiple-choice
        questions. I will describe the implementation that allows
        OpenDSA textbooks to serve CodeWorkout exercises within
        Canvas. OpenDSA does this by being a "man in the middle",
        i.e., by functioning both as a tool consumer (facing
        CodeWorkout) and as a tool provider (facing Canvas)

        ProgSnap 2: Towards a Standard Representation for Programming Process Data
      </h1>
      <p>
        Systems that collect data on student programming activity provide
        a valuable source of information on how students learn to program.
        The diversity of information collected by such systems presents a
        challenge for analyzing data sets, especially for studies involving
        data originating from multiple systems. For this reason, having
        a standardized representation for student programming activity
        would be useful. ProgSnap 2 is a proposed standardized representa-
        tion for programming snapshot data. It is intended to be sufficiently
        flexible to accommodate data from a wide variety of sources, and its
        tabular format is designed to permit direct analysis using statistics
        software.

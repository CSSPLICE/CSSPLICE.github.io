      <h1>Collin Lynch<br/>
        Transaction-Based Analysis of Piazza and other learning platforms
      </h1>

      <p>
        In this talk I will briefly describe our analysis of data from
        online learning platforms with a special attention to our work
        with Piazza.  I will also describe our shared library for
        Piazza data analysis, itself the product of a CSSPLICE grant.
        And I will start the discussion for our initiative to share
        standards for the analysis of transactional data from
        educational platforms.

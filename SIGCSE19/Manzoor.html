        OpenDSA/Mastery Grid Exercise Interchange
      </h1>

      <p>
        OpenDSA is an e-Textbook project developed at Virginia Tech,
        which provides materials to support courses in a wide variety
        of Computer Science-related topics. OpenDSA primarily contains
        Java exercises. Acos is a similar project that supports smart
        learning content, but it contains Python animations and
        exercises. In this project, we present steps toward
        integrating Acos exercises into OpenDSA.

        Similarly, CodeWorkout is an open source system which helps
        students to practice small programming problems. Mastery Grids
        is a tool consumer used at the University of
        Pittsburg. Previously, it only supported exercises provided by
        the Acos server. We are extending the types of problems
        students can practice with by integrating CodeWorkout
        exercises.

        All of this has been possible because all of these tools
        implement LTI, reiterating the importance of why the
        utilization of standards while developing applications is
        important.

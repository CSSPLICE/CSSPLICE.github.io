        OpenDSA/Mastery Grid Exercise Interchange
      </h1>

      <p>
        OpenDSA is an e-Textbook project developed at Virginia Tech,
        which provides materials to support courses in a wide variety
        of Computer Science-related topics. OpenDSA primarily contains
        Java exercises. ACOS server which is a smart learning content
        server developed as a joint project of Aalto University and
        the University of Pittsburgh. It enhances the reusability of
        online learning activities by decoupling the content and the
        existing interoperability protocols including LTI. ACOS is
        capable of serving multiple smart contents including Python
        animations and exercises. In this project, we present steps
        toward integrating smart content served through ACOS into
        OpenDSA.

        Similarly, CodeWorkout is an open source system which helps
        students to practice small programming problems. Mastery Grids
        is also open source progress visualization environment which
        has open (social) learner model features designed at the
        University of Pittsburgh. In this project, we extended
        contents served by Mastery Grids by integrating CodeWorkout
        exercises and visualize student progress in an Open Learner
        Model.

      <p>
        All of this has been possible because all of these tools
        support LTI, reiterating the importance of why the utilization
        of standards while developing applications is important.

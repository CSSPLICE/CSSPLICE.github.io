      <h1>Chris McDonald and Matthew Heinsen Egan<br/>
        Communicating using Program Traces
      </h1>

      <p>
        Supported by the growth of embedded devices, the IoT, and
        modern standardization, C remains an important language for
        undergraduate students.  However, when presented to relatively
        inexperienced programmers, its very limited runtime support is
        a source of frustration for both students and educators, alike.
      </p>

      <p>
        SeeC is a novice-focused tool for the C programming language
        that displays and records the execution of programs, detects
        runtime errors, and enables students to review their programs'
        data and execution history.  Students can deterministically
        replay a program, and reason backwards from a runtime error to
        determine its true cause.  The approach can lead to students'
        reduced frustration and greater understanding of program
        behaviour.
      </p>

      <p>
        This presentation provides a brief overview of SeeC and a
        discussion on how its program traces provide an opportunity
        for students to communicate their questions and
        misunderstandings with educators, and for educators to provide
        examples and debugging challenges to students.

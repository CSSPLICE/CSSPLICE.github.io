      <h1>The SPLICE Catalog</h1>

      <p> The original
        <a href="https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/2062633">SPLICE
        Live Catalog</a> of Smart Learning Content is a Canvas
        "course" that shows off several types of Smart Learning
        Content embedded in Canvas pages so that you can see how they
        work.
        The Live Catalog also serves as a working tutorial on how
        these things can be embedded into other LMS.
        (Note: To see the catalog, you will need to register
        for an account on this site if you don't already have one.)
      </p>

      <p> The new
        <a href="https://splice.cs.vt.edu">SPLICE Catalog</a> is meant
        to be more inclusive in terms of cataloging a wide collection
        of Smart Learning Content, SLC delivery systems, CS Education
        data sets, and relevant data analysis tools. </p>

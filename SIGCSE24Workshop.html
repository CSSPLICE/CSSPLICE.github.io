      <h1>SPLICE'24: Technology and Data Infrastructure for CS Education Research</h1>

      <h2>9th SPLICE Workshop Call for Participation</h2>

      <p>Saturday, March 23, 2024 3:30-6:30 PM Pacific Time, Online
        (An Affiliated Event with SIGCSE'24)</p>

      <p>CS educators and CS Ed researchers and developers are invited to
        the 9th annual SPLICE meeting, focused on creating new Technology
        and Data Infrastructure for CS Education Research.</p>

      <p>To participate in the workshop: Fill out this form:
        <a href="https://forms.gle/Wfysvr4yLhfhfRQHA">https://forms.gle/Wfysvr4yLhfhfRQHA</a>
        by March 15, 2024.</p>

      <p>The mission of the SPLICE project is to develop Technology and Data
        Infrastructure for CS Education Research. At this SPLICE community
        meeting, we invite you to contribute to defining the features of our
        new SPLICE Portal that will provide this infrastructure.</p>

    <p>
      Many SIGCSE attendees are either developing or using online educational tools, 
      and all will benefit from better interoperability among these tools and better 
      analysis of the clickstream data coming from those tools. New tools for analyzing 
      big data leveraged by AI (e.g., deep learning for assessment) in turn improve both content and pedagogy, 
      thus setting up a virtuous cycle fueling learning discoveries and 
      leveraging innovation in AI: Online technologies → big data analysis → better online technologies. 
      This NSF-supported workshop is the latest in a series of SPLICE workshops, and is a continuation 
      of our event at SIGCSE 2023, where the SPLICE-Portal, a dedicated socio-technical research infrastructure 
      for Computing Education Research, was presented. This year, we continue the work with 
      several new SPLICE community working groups, including those on Dashboards, Large Language Models,
      Parsons Problems, and Smart Learning Content Protocols. We continue to build upon our existing 
      collaborations developed over the course of the project to engage more members of the community 
      in tasks that will advance the project agenda.
    </p> 

      <p><b>Who should attend?</b> We encourage you to attend if:</p>
        <ul>        
          <li>You have CS learner data (e.g., from a tool or study) and want to
            analyze or share it.</li>
          <li>You are looking for datasets from CS courses to do
          analysis (e.g., understand student behavior, train a
          model).</li>
          <li>You create systems/tools to support CS learning that you
          want to be useful in other classrooms. Especially if you
          want your tool to integrate with other tools.</li>
          <li>You teach CS and want to use high-quality learning
            content and tools (like these examples) made by others.</li>
          </ul>

<p><b>What will you do at the workshop?</b> You will:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Learn about existing tools, data and research infrastructure
    that can help you improve your CS teaching and research, and share
    your content with others.</li>
<li>Opportunity to get feedback on your own research or teaching
  project, with support from like-minded peers, and SPLICE experts who
  can connect you to datasets, tools, and infrastructure that can help
  you accomplish your goals.</li>
  <li>Help shape the next generation of CS research infrastructure.</li>
  </ul>

  <b>How much does it cost?</b>
   <p>  
        All participants are expected to register for both SIGCSE'24 and the workshop
        <a href="https://sigcse2024.sigcse.org/attending/Registration+">SIGCSE Registration</a>.</br>
        SPICE project has limited funding to support workshop participants. 
        For those who need support, the workshop registration fee will be refunded. </br> 
        Limited funding is also available to cover one extra night hotel stay in Portland to
        facilitate workshop attendance.

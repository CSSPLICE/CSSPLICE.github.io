      <h1>ProgSnap2</h1>
      <p>
        <b>ProgSnap2</b> is a proposed specification for datasets containing
        programming process data&mdash;i.e., data captured from programming
        activity (typically in an educational setting.) The specification is currently
        in Beta status; several datasets have been implementd using the specification,
        and several analyses performed on them.
        See the <a href="#current-draft">Current draft</a> section below.
      </p>
      <p>
        ProgSnap2 was created by the members of the SPLICE Small Code Snapshots
        working group.  The group leaders are
        <a href="mailto:twprice@ncsu.edu">Thomas Price</a> and
        <a href="mailto:ayaank@calpoly.edu">Ayaan Kazerouni</a>.

        <b>07/20:</b> The <a href="https://sites.google.com/ncsu.edu/csedm-ws-edm-2020/data-challenge">2nd CSEDM Data Challenge</a> has been announced. It will use ProgSnap2 as a specification 
        for multiple datasets from different institutions. Follow the link to sign up!

        <b>06/20:</b> Price et al. published a study in ITiCSE '20 that demonstrated how five datasets collected
        from a variety of institutions by different researchers could all be refactored to meet
        the ProgSnap2 specification. The team showed that a single analysis script could then be run
        on each of the datasets to compare metrics (Error Quotient, Repeated Error Density, and Watwin score),
        even though three of the datasets could not be shared with the analysis script programmers due to privacy concerns.

      <h2>DATASTAND</h2>
      <p>
        ProgSnap2 borrows heavily from the <a href="../DATASTAND.pdf">DATASTAND Group Notes</a> document
        created by John Stamper, Stephen Edwards, Andrew Petersen, Thomas Price, and
        Ian Utting at ICER 2017.
      </p>

      <h2>Repository</h2>
      <p>
        There is a <a href="https://github.com/CSSPLICE/progsnap2">GitHub repository</a> that contains some
        converter scripts and some examples.
        [Note: This could use some work.
        Ideally, someone would add converters and real datasets!]

      <h1>SPLICE Working Group: Smart Learning Content Protocols</h1>

      <p><b>Leaders</b>: Cay Horstmann, Steve Edwards.</p>

      <p><b>Rationale</b>
        Standard learning system APIs such as LTI are complex and often
        incorporate server-side components. Too often systems that
        integrate smart learning content use proprietary APIs that
        restrict interoperability. This proposal aims to enable learning
        systems to make use of compliant smart content by lowering the
        cost of entry through simple minimalistic APIs. The purpose of 
        this working group is to formulate an API that allows smart 
        learning content authors to signal user activity, and learning
        system implemebters to record it. Learning system implementors
        can also choose to offer a state restoration service to the
        smart learning content. Specifically, we aim to standardize two
        parts:
        <ul>
          <li>
            A JavaScript API that the smart content implementor invokes
            for communicating with learning systems
          </li>
          <li>
            The postMessage protocol that is used when the content is
            embedded in an iframe
          </li>
        </ul>
        We provide a reference implementation for a client library that
        turns the JavaScript API into the message protocol. We also provide
        a reference server implementation that produces an LTI launch,
        embedding an arbitrary web page as an iframe and bridging the message
        protocol to LTI. With this server, pages containing smart learning
        content can be included in standard learning management systems such
        as Canvas.</p>
